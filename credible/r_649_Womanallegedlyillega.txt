- An Iowa woman was arrested after she allegedly voted for Donald Trump twice in the general election, police said.

Terri Lynn Rote was arrested on Thursday and charged with first-degree election misconduct, according to records, after she reportedly claimed she thought her first vote would be changed to a vote for Hillary Clinton.

Police said Rote cast her first vote on Oct. 4 at the Polk County Election Office, and again on Oct. 21 at a county satellite voting site.

"The polls are rigged," Rote told the Iowa Public Radio Station.

Rote also told the Washington Post she wasn't planning on voting for Trump twice but it was a "spur of the moment" act.

"I don't know what came over me," Rote said.

Rote was released on Friday after posting $5,000 and will appear in court on Nov 7.
