- If you've driven on Interstate 10 near Sky Harbor Airport, it was hard to miss: a Donald Trump "Make America Great Again" sign -- but now the sign is gone -- a victim of vandalism.

The sign is gone because someone spray painted nearly a dozen swastikas in an attempt to cancel out one political message with another one.

Take a look at the video from SkyFOX over I-10 just past the Interstate 17 split.

Trump backers are angry.

"You know, it is one of these things.. there is passion and emotion behind elections, but when people deface signs, they are taking away First Amendment rights when they deface billboards and things like this," said Robert Graham of the Arizona Republican Party.

Phoenix Police are looking for whoever is responsible for the vandalism. Their bias squad is involved. So far, investigators say no video has been located.

The entire billboard has now been blacked-over because of the graffiti.

"This is nothing short of cheating to dismantle elections. It is not issue-oriented, no proper decorum or discussion," said Graham.

Graffiti artists are breaking the law. Police hope anyone who knows about the graffiti will get in touch with them.
