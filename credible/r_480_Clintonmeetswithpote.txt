Story highlights Clinton is meeting with people Friday at her home to go over her running mate selection process

Warren is on Clinton's short list of possible vice presidential picks

Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton met Friday with several high-profile potential vice presidential picks at her Washington, D.C., home, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro.

The series of meetings come as Clinton finalizes her running mate selection process, a source familiar with the process told CNN, and hours after presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump officially named Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his No. 2.

Campaign chairman John Podesta, who is heading Clinton's VP vetting process, and campaign vice chair Huma Abedin were also in the house during the meetings.

Brian Fallon, a Clinton campaign spokesman, would only say in a statement that Clinton "held a series of campaign-related meetings at her Washington home, including several about her vice presidential selection process."
