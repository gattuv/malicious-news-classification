Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he is willing to spend tens of millions of dollars of his own fortune to self-fund his presidential campaign during the general election against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

"As far as I'm concerned I'd be very happy to continue to self fund," Trump said in an interview at Trump Tower with ABC News "World News Tonight" anchor David Muir.

Campaign finance reports released overnight show that Trump brought in 5.3 million in May -- $2.2 million of that he loaned to the campaign. The GOP candidate has about $1.3 million in cash on hand. Clinton, by contrast, raised more than $25 million in May.

In the interview with Muir, Trump brushed off the large fundraising gap, accusing Clinton of "getting the money from the Wall Street guys and all the special interests."

Although Trump now has a joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee, which began in May, he did not close the door on pouring more of his own money into his campaign war chest.

"I'll be honest, I think I could spend $50, $60, $70 million of my own money and run a wonderful campaign," Trump told Muir. "Now, would I have as many ads as her? No."

He predicted Clinton would spend more than $1 billion on her campaign.

"I don't think that kind of money is necessary," Trump said, using his spending during the primary season as an example. "Remember this: I spent $50 million, and I won. Other people that were running against me spent many times that amount, and they lost -- not even close."
