Butte is no stranger to protests. However, it's been almost a century since miners took to the streets to demonstrate against the Anaconda company.

Since, voters found out on election night that Donald Trump was going to be president, some did not waste time expressing their disapproval. We have seen the news coverage, protesters in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and even Portland.

As result, we decided to asked people in Butte to weigh in on the anti-Trump protesting that's been going on.

"I kind of agree because Donald Trump has said some things that is pretty questionable," said Brian Smith, Butte local.

"I just don't believe more violence is the answer. I think if they can do it nice and safe...hate just brings violence," said Desirae Sterk, Butte local.

"I agree with the protesting...because I am a astonished Democratic and I think Hillary is much smarter," said Connie Globan, Butte local.

The anti-Trump protesting has been going on for five days now. It is unknown when these protests will come to an end.
