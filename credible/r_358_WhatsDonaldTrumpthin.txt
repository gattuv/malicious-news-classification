Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, whose penchant for Twitter has become legendary on the campaign trail, is live-tweeting Tuesday night's debate between his running mate Mike Pence and the Democrats' veep candidate Tim Kaine -- and he's not pulling any punches.

But as he began watching the debate from Nevada, Trump began his night with a jab at someone who's not on the stage -- Fox News' Megyn Kelly. In an apparent reference to Kelly's joking remark earlier in the evening that Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway would be policing his Twitter feed, Trump gave this snarky response:

.@megynkelly- I am in Nevada. Sorry to inform you Kellyanne is in the audience. Better luck next time. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2016

Trump has also retweeted several supporters slamming Kaine on the debate stage, saying the Democratic vice presidential candidate "looks like a fool" and "looks like an evil crook out of the Batman movies."

"@Jnelson52722: @realDonaldTrump @Susiesentinel Kaine looks like an evil crook out of the Batman movies" -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2016

Trump continued with other attacks on the Clinton-Kaine ticket, adding in another tweet that his rival "Smeers At Millions Of Average Americans":

Trump also seemed to accuse CBS News' Elaine Quijano, the moderator of Tuesday's debate, of unfairly favoring Kaine. The GOP nominee retweeted and commented "So true!" on a message from a supporter that said they "cannot believe how often the moderator interrupts #Pence vs the other guy":

"@AnyoneTennis: @timkaine Cannot believe how often the moderator interrupts #Pence vs the other guy...so obvious @FoxNews" So true! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2016

Trump concluded his live-tweeting session with a declaration that his running mate was the victor of the debate.
