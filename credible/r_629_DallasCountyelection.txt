- A polling place in Grand Prairie opened late Tuesday morning because the election judge was found dead in his home.

Dallas County elections officials confirmed the polls at the Betty Warmack Library on Bardin Road did not open until after 9 a.m. An alternative judge had to be called in to oversee Precinct 4502 because Judge Gary Lee Cox did not show up for work.

Grand Prairie police officers went to his apartment for a welfare check around 8 a.m. They found him dead apparently from natural causes, police said.

Dallas County Elections Administrator Toni Pippins-Poole said that particular polling place will be open until 9 p.m. because of the two-hour delay.

"We have petitioned the courts to extend the voting here for two hours after close because we did have voters that were in line and a lot of voters did leave because they had to go to work," she said.

Cox's family said he lived with diabetes for some time. They also said he loved being involved with the elections process and was absolutely looking forward to Election Day.

Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said ballots cast after 7 p.m. will be provisional pending further review of statute and judicial authority.
