Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump described his comments from a 2005 leaked video as "locker room talk"

American athletes have condemned Donald Trump on social media for claiming that obscene comments about groping women were just "locker room talk".

The Republican presidential nominee, whose comments were broadcast in a leaked 2005 tape, apologised for the remarks but said they were "just words" and repeatedly referred to the context of the "locker room" during Sunday's second presidential debate against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

However, US sporting stars were quick to dismiss Trump's explanation.

Former Leeds United winger and current LA Galaxy player Robbie Rogers - who in 2013 became the first openly gay athlete to play in Major League Soccer - was one of those who took offence.

Eighteen-time Grand Slam singles winner Martina Navratilova also had strong words for Trump.

NBA Portland Trail Blazers' CJ McCollum and LA Clippers' Jamal Crawford also rejected Trump's comments.

As did former Philadelphia 76ers basketball player Kendall Marshall.

Trump's argument drew reactions from a range of sports, with Oakland Athletics baseball pitcher Sean Doolittle adding his name to the criticism.

Atlanta Falcons tight end Jacob Tamme and former New England receiver Donte Stallworth both urged Trump to leave the locker room out of it.

And English former NBA star John Amaechi also added his voice to the criticism.

Outside the sporting world, reactions to Trump's comments were less unanimous. BBC Trending has sampled the public mood here.
