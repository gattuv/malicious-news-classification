Dulce Matuz, who may be the best known "Dreamer" in the country, is a young immigrant who came to the U.S. as a child with her parents and she wants the same rights as those who were born in the country.

Recently, she was named one of Time Magazine's "100 Most Influential People" and she's speaking out about what she hopes to hear from Trump at tonight's rally.
