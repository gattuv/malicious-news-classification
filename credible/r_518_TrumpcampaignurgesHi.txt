Washington (CNN) As the blowback to Donald Trump's public feud with a Gold Star family escalated on Monday, the GOP nominee's campaign sent out talking points to congressional supporters urging them to come to his defense.

The appeal didn't generate much back-up for Trump. His continued back-and-forth with Muslim-American parents of a US soldier killed in Iraq left most Hill Republicans perplexed at how the GOP nominee wouldn't let go of a spat with a grieving couple.

Scott Mason, one of the Trump campaign's Hill liaisons, emailed congressional supporters Monday afternoon with a lengthy response to the Khizr Kahn, whose speech at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia drew national attention. In it, Khan offered tough pushback to Trump's proposed temporary ban on Muslim immigration and an emotional story about his son who died fighting in the Iraq War.

Mason's message was for Hill offices to push out the campaign's messages via press releases and social media to counter Khan's continued critique of Trump, and encouraged offices to "forward to me ASAP."

The request came after Republican senator and former P.O.W., John McCain of Arizona, sent out a scathing take down on Trump earlier in the day for "disparaging" Khizr and Ghazala Kahn.
