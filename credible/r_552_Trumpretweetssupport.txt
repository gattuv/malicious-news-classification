Donald Trump promised his Twitter followers that he would livetweet Tuesday night's vice presidential debate between Mike Pence and Tim Kaine, but the Republican nominee mostly retweeted his supporters.

Trump tweeted "Both are looking good! Now we begin!" in the early moments of the showdown. He then tweeted at Fox News' Megyn Kelly to say he was watching the debate in Nevada.

.@megynkelly- I am in Nevada. Sorry to inform you Kellyanne is in the audience. Better luck next time. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2016

Trump's next 17 posts were all retweets. Most were messages from supporters, including one from a Twitter user who compared Kaine, Hillary Clinton's running mate, to a Batman villain.

"@Jnelson52722: @realDonaldTrump @Susiesentinel Kaine looks like an evil crook out of the Batman movies" -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2016

Another user retweeted by Trump said Clinton "gets Americans killed."

Trump also retweeted graphics favorably comparing Kaine's record as Indiana governor to Kaine's record as Virginia governor. Other tweets included links to campaign press releases about Clinton's policy on Syria and North Korea, as well as a reminder of the Democratic candidate's "basket of deplorables" remark about Trump supporters last month.

Trump also backed up Pence's support of law enforcement officers in a segment of the debate devoted to police shootings of African-Americans.

I agree Mike - thank you to all of our law enforcement officers! #VPDebate
