ABC News projects that Donald Trump will win both the West Virginia Republican primary and the Nebraska Republican primary, based on exit poll analysis.

Trump released this statement Tuesday night, following his projected wins: "It is a great honor to have won both West Virginia and Nebraska, especially by such massive margins. My time spent in both states was a wonderful and enlightening experience for me. I learned a lot, and that knowledge will be put to good use towards the creation of businesses, jobs, and the strengthening and revival of their economies."

He added, "I look forward to returning to West Virginia and Nebraska soon, and hope to win both states in the general election. Likewise, my time spent last week with the great people of Oregon will hopefully lead to another victory next Tuesday."

Now that Trump is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, preliminary exit polls show greater unity on the Republican side than previously seen in past contests.

Preliminary exit polls show that in a Trump-Hillary Clinton matchup, nine in 10 West Virginia GOP voters and eight in 10 in Nebraska say they'd vote for Trump in November.

Eight in 10 primary voters from West Virginia are excited or optimistic about what Trump would do in office if he were elected president.

With these uncontested primaries, Trump moves closer to the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the GOP nomination before this summer's convention.
