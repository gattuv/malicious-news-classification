- The City of Philadelphia filed a motion in state court seeking an injunction to temporarily stop the SEPTA strike for Election Day, according to a new press release.

The release says that the Court is expected to hear the City's motion at 9:30 a.m. Monday.

"On November 8, 2016, hundreds of thousands of Philadelphians will cast ballots for President, Senator, and other important offices. The City has a legal responsibility to ensure that Philadelphians can exercise their constitutional right to vote," said City Solicitor Sozi Pedro Tulante.

"Though there are extensive efforts to minimize the effect of any transit strike on Election Day, unquestionably, such an Election-Day strike will make it practically impossible for many Philadelphians to participate in this election.

"While there is still time for SEPTA and TWU to resolve the strike before Election Day, the Law Department must act now to ensure that as many Philadelphia residents as possible can vote without disruption. As a result, we are asking the Court for temporary relief."

The City is not taking a position on SEPTA's request for a more permanent injunction, and is just requesting an injunction for Election Day only, according to the press release.

The SEPTA strike entered Day 6 on Sunday.
