WASHINGTON (AP) - President-elect Donald Trump has arrived in Washington for his meeting with President Barack Obama.



Trump flew from New York on his private jet and landed at Reagan National Airport, just outside of the U.S. capital.



While Trump huddles with the president in the Oval Office, his wife, Melania Trump, will meet privately with first lady Michelle Obama.



From the White House, Trump will travel to Capitol Hill for separate meetings with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
