Donald Trump's poll numbers have crept up on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, with Trump now within the margin of error in the three swing states of Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio.

The latest Quinnipiac University polls, released today, show Trump leading in Florida and Pennsylvania and tied in Ohio. In Florida, Trump leads 42 percent to Clinton's 39 percent. In Pennsylvania, Trump leads 43 percent to Clinton's 41 percent, also within the margin of error. And in Ohio, Trump and Clinton are tied at 40 percent.

The recent numbers are a dramatic shift from the most recent Quinnipiac poll released June 21. Three weeks ago, Clinton was leading Trump in Florida by 8 points with 47 percent, compared with Trump's 39 percent.

Clinton has now lost support among Floridian females voters, according to the latest Quinnipiac poll. Women support Clinton 48 percent to Trump's 36 percent, a shift from the June 21 poll numbers showing Clinton with 52 percent of the female vote, compared with Trump's 34 percent.

But Clinton still leads Trump with large margins in all three states when it comes to non-white voters. The biggest margin is in Pennsylvania, where Clinton leads Trump in the non-white vote 72 percent to 12 percent.

Negative favorability ratings are a commonality for both Trump and Clinton in all three swing states, with neither candidate having a positive favorability rating.

Swing state voting has historically been vital to winning the presidency, with no candidate winning the ticket since 1960 without winning two of the three state races.

Brian Fallon, the Hillary for America spokesman, tweeted shortly after the latest poll numbers were released, saying they predicted it would be a close race.
