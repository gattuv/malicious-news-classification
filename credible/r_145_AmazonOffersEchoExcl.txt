Amazon Echo users are in luck: The retailer is offering some Echo-exclusive deals in the run-up to its annual Amazon Prime Day shopping extravaganza.

Customers who use the artificially intelligent speaker, which answers to the name Alexa, can get $10 off their first eligible order over $20 when shopping through their Echo. Amazon said the process is as easy as saying, "Alexa, order dog food," or any other of the thousands of eligible items.

According to an email from the company, the deal is available now through July 12, which is Amazon Prime Day. In addition to the $10 coupon, Amazon said it will offer special Echo-exclusive deals in the lead-up to Prime Day.

Amazon Prime members pay $99 a year for free two-day shipping and access to streaming media.

On its second annual Prime Day sale, it's expected Prime members will have access to more than 100,000 deals.

In addition to its standard lightning deals this week, the retailer will offer four to six special deals from midnight Pacific time until inventory lasts. Each day's offers will have a different theme.
