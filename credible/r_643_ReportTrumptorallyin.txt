- Donald Trump will supposedly be heading to Tampa next week, fresh off the New Hampshire primary.

The Tampa Bay Times reports that Trump will be appearing at the USF Sun Dome on Friday, February 12.

Trump was the runner-up amidst a crowded Republican field in this week's presidential caucuses in Iowa. The first of the season's traditional primaries is next Tuesday in New Hampshire, which may bring more clarity to the race for the GOP nod.

Trump will be campaigning in the backyard of two of his rivals. Sen. Marco Rubio placed third in Iowa, and former governor Jeb Bush finished sixth.
