Donald Trump, the new president-elect of the United States, once said he punched a teacher in the face when he was in the second grade. So did he?

Here's what he wrote in his 1987 book, "The Art of the Deal":

Even in elementary school, I was a very assertive, aggressive kid. In the second grade I actually gave a teacher a black eye. I punched my music teacher because I didn't think he knew anything about music and I almost got expelled. I'm not proud of that, but it's clear evidence that even early on I had a tendency to stand up and make my opinions known in a forceful way. The difference now is that I like to use my brain instead of my fists.

I asked Trump spokespeople whether they had any comment on the passage from years ago, and what the president-elect would advise students today to do when they have a disagreement with a teacher. There was no response.

Given that Trump has repeatedly said things that weren't true about a variety of topics, it seems fair to ask whether he really did punch a teacher.

According to the book "Trump Revealed: An American Journey of Ambition, Ego, Money, and Power," by Washington Post reporters Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher, Trump attended the private Kew-Forest School in Forest Hills, N.Y., where he often got into trouble. He and his friends would disrupt class "with wisecracks and unruly behavior, such as throwing spitballs and playing racing chairs with desks."
