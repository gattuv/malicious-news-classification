Story highlights Hillary Clinton came to Flint on Sunday, taking a break from campaigning in New Hampshire

Clinton's appearance in a majority African-American city will resonate in early voting states like South Carolina and Nevada

Flint, Michigan (CNN) Hillary Clinton promised the people of Flint, Michigan, whose lives have been turned upside down by the city's ongoing water crisis, that she will be their partner in what is sure to be a long recovery.

Speaking from the pulpit at House of Prayer Memorial Baptist Church on Sunday, Clinton told a largely African-American audience that what has happened in Flint, where untreated water has been contaminated with lead, is not just an environmental crisis, but one deeply imbued with race.

"This is not merely unacceptable or wrong, though it is both, what happened in Flint is immoral," Clinton said.

"This has to be a national priority, not just for today or tomorrow. Clean water is not optional, my friends, it is not a luxury. As I said weeks ago, if what had been happening in Flint had happened in Grosse Point or Bloomfield Hills, I think we all know we would have had a solution yesterday," Clinton added, referencing two wealthy, largely white Detroit suburbs.

Clinton came to Flint on Sunday, taking a break from campaigning in New Hampshire days before the state's critical primary on Tuesday, to stress the need to urge the Republican controlled Senate to approve the Senate Democrats' $600 million amendment to help Flint.
