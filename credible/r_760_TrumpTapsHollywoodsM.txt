Mr. Trump also took time Tuesday night to have dinner with Mitt Romney, whose name has been mentioned as a potential secretary of state, and who has become a source of contention among members of the transition team.

Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who called Mr. Trump a "phony" and a "fraud" during the Republican primaries, sat down for a four-course meal Tuesday night at Jean-Georges, a three-star Michelin restaurant at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Manhattan.

Mr. Romney emerged several hours later to heap compliments on the president-elect, who has bristled privately that Mr. Romney never apologized for insulting him during the race.

There was no apology, but Mr. Romney said he had been impressed by Mr. Trump's victory speech on election night, his transition effort and his personnel decisions.

"He did something I tried to do and was unsuccessful in accomplishing: He won the general election," Mr. Romney told reporters.

The appointments on Tuesday included Elaine L. Chao -- a veteran of past Republican administrations who is married to Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader -- as transportation secretary. She will be charged with steering the infrastructure initiative through a divided Congress and the federal bureaucracy. Mr. Trump also announced that he would nominate Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, a physician who has been a fierce opponent of the health care law, as his secretary of health and human services -- tasked with leading his efforts to dismantle the measure.

And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump will announce Wilbur Ross, the billionaire investor, as his secretary of commerce, according to the transition team.

The moves suggested that Mr. Trump was seeking experienced policy makers who have deep relationships in Washington to shepherd his most sweeping pledges.

In Ms. Chao, Mr. Trump is turning to a former secretary of labor under President George W. Bush. Her experience on Capitol Hill will be necessary to take on what will have to be a bipartisan infrastructure effort in Congress. Aides said Mr. Trump's choice of Mr. Price underscored the president-elect's commitment to move swiftly -- as early as his first day in office -- to roll back the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama's signature domestic policy achievement, and replace it.

Ms. Chao, who was born in Taiwan, brings a third woman to cabinet-level positions in a Trump administration and an additional degree of diversity to the president-elect's team, so far filled largely with conservative white men who have scoffed at political convention.

Democrats said they were cautiously optimistic about working with Ms. Chao to forge a bipartisan infrastructure deal. "I hope Secretary Chao shares that ambitious goal and is willing to work with Democrats to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of good-paying jobs along the way," said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who is set to become the new minority leader.

But Ms. Chao was quickly criticized by liberal groups who said she was emblematic of the very corporate-driven political establishment Mr. Trump had promised to dismantle. Some policy analysts argued that as labor secretary she had inadequately protected employee rights, and the Center for American Progress called her selection an "ominous sign for workers."

The selection of Mr. Price, who has served in Congress since 2005, revealed deeper partisan divisions.

Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan and the chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, called Mr. Price "a brilliant choice," adding, "I'm glad that we'll have a doctor who knows health care inside and out leading the way."

But Democrats and their allies voiced alarm.

Richard J. Fiesta, the executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, which represents retired union members, said he was "horrified" by the selection of Mr. Price. Marcia D. Greenberger, a president of the National Women's Law Center, a research and advocacy group, said Mr. Price "would have a devastating impact on women's health."

In Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Trump has an ally whose nomination is expected to be well received on Wall Street, a number of traders and bankers contacted on Tuesday said.

Since Mr. Trump's victory, United States equity markets have hit record highs, with financial institutions leading the way. Having a Treasury secretary with broad experience as a financier is likely to sustain the view that a Trump administration will look favorably on Wall Street, not least in terms of pulling back some regulations put in place by Mr. Obama.

Mr. Mnuchin was an early supporter of Mr. Trump. When Mr. Trump won New York's Republican presidential primary contest in April, Mr. Mnuchin attended the victory party. The next day, he accepted Mr. Trump's invitation to become the campaign's national finance chairman.

Mr. Mnuchin, the son of a Goldman Sachs partner, joined the firm after graduating from Yale. He worked there for 17 years, rising to oversee trading in government securities and mortgage bonds.

He would be the third Goldman Sachs alumnus to serve as Treasury secretary, and the announcement of his appointment drew swift condemnation from liberal groups who said he had cashed in on the country's financial collapse.

"He purchased a bailed-out bank for pennies on the dollar and then aggressively foreclosed on tens of thousands of families," Jon Green, a spokesman for the Take on Wall Street campaign, said in a statement. "Anyone concerned about Wall Street billionaires rigging the economy should be terrified by the prospect of a Treasury Secretary Mnuchin."

The group was apparently referring to Mr. Mnuchin's role in 2009 in a group that bought the failed California mortgage lender IndyMac from the government. He became the chairman of the company, renamed OneWest, which was ultimately sold to CIT, the nation's largest small-business lender, in 2015 for more than twice the price the group had paid.

During Mr. Mnuchin's tenure, OneWest faced allegations that it had foreclosed improperly on some borrowers. Fair-housing groups also filed a complaint with the federal government, claiming that OneWest was not meeting its legal obligation to make loans in minority neighborhoods.

Mr. Mnuchin was the latest in a string of wealthy donors whom Mr. Trump has selected for top posts in his cabinet, including Mr. Ross; Todd Ricketts, a Republican megadonor and an owner of the Chicago Cubs, who is expected to be the deputy commerce secretary; and Betsy DeVos, a school choice activist and Republican fund-raiser, who he announced would be his education secretary.

Mr. Mnuchin has conducted past business deals with the president-elect -- but not always under the best of circumstances. Mr. Mnuchin's hedge fund, Dune Capital Management, helped finance construction of a Trump project in Chicago. In 2008, Mr. Trump sued Dune and other lenders to extend the loan terms. The parties ultimately settled.

The selections on Tuesday came as Mr. Trump huddled with advisers and potential cabinet officials in Trump Tower in Manhattan.

Among the issues is whether Mr. Trump should name Mr. Romney as his secretary of state. After their dinner, Mr. Romney told reporters that Mr. Trump "continues with a message of inclusion and bringing people together, and his vision is something which obviously connected with the American people in a very powerful way."

He said Mr. Trump's conduct since winning the election gives "me increasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to that better future."
