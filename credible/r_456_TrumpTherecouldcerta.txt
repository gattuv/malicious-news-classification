Story highlights "There could certainly be a softening because we're not looking to hurt people," Trump said

Trump's policies have been harshly criticized by Democrats and some Republicans

Washington (CNN) Donald Trump says there could be a "softening" in his hardline immigration proposals -- though he did not provide detail and his campaign so far has yet to offer a coordinated message on whether there's been a shift in policy.

Speaking to Fox News' Sean Hannity in an interview Tuesday night, Trump was asked about a recent meeting he had with the National Hispanic Advisory Council, a group of Hispanic supporters.

"Is there any part of the law that you might be able to change that would accommodate those people that contribute to society, have been law abiding, have kids here -- would there be any room in your mind because I know you had a meeting this week with Hispanic leaders," Hannity said.

"I did," Trump replied. "I had a great meeting with great people, great Hispanic leaders, and there could certainly be a softening because we're not looking to hurt people. We want people -- we have some great people in this country. We have some great, great people in this country but we're going to follow the laws of this country and what people don't realize -- we have very, very strong laws."

Trump did not provide further details.
