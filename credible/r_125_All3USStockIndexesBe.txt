All three major U.S. stock indexes closed at record highs Thursday, the first time this has happened since 1999.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 117.65 points, or 0.6 percent, to 18,613.31. The S&P 500 jumped 10.30 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,185.79 and the Nasdaq rose 23.81 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,228.40.

The indices were boosted by strong retail stocks, including better-than-expected results from Macy's, and a rally in oil prices.

Shares of Macy's ended the session up more than 17 percent.

Kohl's, JC Penney and Nordstrom also performed strongly.

Alphabet, Google's parent company, IBM, and Amazon.com all beat their previous all-time highs.
