Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump doesn't think he needs to earn the support of House Speaker Paul Ryan.

"I really think I earned the support from the people. You know, we've gotten more votes than anybody in this position that's ever run for the office," Trump told George Stephanopoulos in an interview that will air on "This Week" Sunday.

Trump also has a message to deliver to Ryan when he meets with him on Capitol Hill next week. "I'm gonna say, 'Look, this is what the people want,'" he said.

Ryan invited Trump to meet with GOP leaders next week, following a battle this week between the two, started after Ryan said he wasn't ready to support Trump's candidacy.

"I hope to support our nominee, I hope to support his candidacy going forward," Ryan said in an interview with CNN on Thursday. "I'm just not ready to do that at this point. I'm not there right now."

Trump also responded to Jeb Bush saying he "understands" why the former Republican presidential candidate and Florida governor said he won't vote for him.

Bush took an even stronger stance against Trump than Ryan, saying he will not vote for him or Hillary Clinton in the general election. "In November, I will not vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, but I will support principled conservatives at the state and federal levels, just as I have done my entire life," the former said in a Facebook post.

"I understand Jeb Bush. I was rough with Jeb Bush. And I think if I was Jeb Bush I wouldn't vote for me either, if you want to know the truth," Trump told Stephanopoulos.
