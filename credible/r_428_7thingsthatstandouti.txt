Nearly 400 pages of documents and "playbooks" from Trump University, the now-defunct series of real estate seminars started by presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, were unsealed Tuesday.

The documents show how staffers for Trump University sold the expensive program to potential students, even those with financial limitations such as credit card debt or expenses related to children. They were unsealed as part of a lawsuit against Trump University brought by former customers saying they were defrauded by the school.

On Wednesday, the judge in the case ordered some of the documents resealed because some records had been released by mistake.

Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and her campaign have sharply criticized Trump over the issue, with Clinton saying in New Jersey Wednesday that the program indicates Trump is "a fraud. "Donald Trump enriched himself at the expense of hard working people," Clinton said, calling Trump University "just more evidence that Donald Trump himself is a fraud."

The Trump campaign released this video, featuring three Trump University students who defended the courses:

A Trump spokesperson responded Wednesday, saying the evidence in the case "demonstrates the high level of satisfaction from students."

"The Court's order unsealing documents has no bearing on the merits of Trump University's case," the statement reads. "Much of the unsealed evidence, including declarations and surveys from former Trump University students, demonstrates the high level of satisfaction from students and that Trump University taught valuable real estate information. Trump University looks forward to using this evidence, along with much more, to win when the case is brought before a jury."
