Donald Trump brought in a new campaign CEO and promoted a pollster to campaign manager after a tumultuous few weeks that have seen the GOP contender's poll numbers drop amid a series of controversies.

The campaign announced early Wednesday the addition of Stephen Bannon as campaign CEO, while promoting pollster Kellyanne Conway to campaign manager. Bannon formerly worked for the conservative news website Breitbart News.

"I've known both of them for a long time," Trump told The Associated Press. "They're terrific people, they're winners, they're champs, and we need to win it."

"I believe we're adding some of the best talents in politics, with the experience and expertise needed to defeat Hillary Clinton in November," Trump said in a statement.

Sources told ABC News the campaign felt a need for a senior aide to take on a traveling role with Trump to help focus the candidate's messaging. This will be Conway's role as campaign manager.

Bannon will occupy "a new position designed to bolster the businesslike approach of Mr. Trump's campaign," the statement said, adding that his duties will include oversight of the campaign staff and operations.

The changes, announced early Wednesday morning, were in the making for weeks, sources told ABC News. Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, who has come under fire recently over questions about his role in a corruption scandal in Ukraine, will maintain his role. Trump's senior staff will huddle on Wednesday to go over the changes.

Wednesday's leadership makeover isn't the first for the Trump campaign. Manafort took the reins in June after Trump fired former chairman Corey Lewandowski after missteps such as Lewandowski's being charged with battery over an altercation with protesters at a rally. The charges were later dropped.

Additional senior hires are expected in the next few days, The Associated Press reported.
