Donut controversy for local Dunkin' Donuts Arizona News Donut controversy for local Dunkin' Donuts A particular, special donut is causing some controversy for one Valley Dunkin' Donut shop. FOX 10's Steve Kraft reports.

- A Dunkin' Donuts store in the Valley has generated some controversy with some new donuts they made, in the aftermath of Donald Trump's successful bid for President.

The idea was reportedly to make a timely sort of comment on the election that has just concluded, a whimsical moment of inspiration for the bakers at the shop, and something to talk about for the customers, and then to eat.

Some found the idea amusing, but others, not so much.

The donuts had red and blue on white frosting, and one says "Trump", and the other, "wall", a reference to Trump's campaign pledge to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Customers spoke out on the donuts Thursday.

"I am pro-America, so I don't see anything wrong with them," said Suzanne Culp. "I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase them, but it is a way to support America."

"It is going to get a lot of controversy," said Rich Culp. "Not the donuts but the wall, because we live here in Arizona."

Those who made the donuts said they are doing it in a lighthearted way, but they are aware that it's possible not everyone will find it funny.

"Families are being separated, deportations are a reality we face," said Erika Oballe. "Sure, it is a stupid donut, but what is the point? Who is laughing at it?"

"I don't know, but I think they took it too far," said Cynthia Ramirez. "But everybody has a right to their opinion, and if that is what they want, it is not my business. They can do what they feel."\

FOX 10 has contacted Dunkin' Donuts, and the company has seen the story on the FOX 10 Phoenix Facebook page, along with reactions from some FOX 10 viewers. In response, company officials said "Thanks for reaching out. We take these matters seriously, and have notified the appropriate teams."
