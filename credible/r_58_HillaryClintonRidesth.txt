Hillary Clinton was just like us today.

The took a short ride on the New York City subway this morning, where she rode the No. 4 train in the Bronx one stop: From Yankee Stadium at 167th street up to 170th street.

She then made her way to Munch Time, a diner in the Bronx.

Clinton's Metrocard didn't work at first when she tried to enter through the turnstile. But after swiping it a few times, she eventually got through.

Despite the brief delay, Clinton did seem familiar enough with how to ride a subway. (Her opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, raised some eyebrows earlier this week when the Brooklyn-born Vermont senator told the New York Daily News that to ride a subway today, "You get a token and you get in.")

As Clinton took the train uptown, the former New York senator told reporters she last rode the subway 18 months or 2 years ago.

Before the ride, Clinton also responded to Sanders' remarks Wednesday night that she is not qualified to be president of the United States.

She had clearly planned to take the high road. "It's kind of a silly thing to say, but I'm going to trust the voters of New York who know me, who have voted for me three times. Twice for Senate," she told reporters. "Look, I don't know why he's saying that. But I will take Bernie Sanders over Donald Trump or Ted Cruz any time. So let's keep our eye on what's really at stake in this election."

Clinton and Sanders both plan to campaign vigorously in New York -- a state with ties to both of them -- ahead of the primary on April 19.
