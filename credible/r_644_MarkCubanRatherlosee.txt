Billionaire entrepreneur and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban responded to talk of boycotts against his brands because of his regular criticism of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

"When it's all said and done, I'd rather lose every penny than have Trump as president, because I care more about the future of my family and my children than I do about my pocketbook," he told NBC Sports Radio, "And if that means we play to empty arenas, I'm down with that."

"Maybe I pick up some fans, maybe I lose some fans. I don't know," he said, according to the Dallas Morning News.

He told the station he voted early in Texas for Democrat Hillary Clinton, and offered a comedic jab to those fearing voter fraud against the Republican candidate: "I voted 17 times, just for Trump fans," he said.
