Ahead of his victory in the New Hampshire primary, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said his campaign was getting "great signals" that he would win in the Granite State.

"Whatever rally, you know, many, many people would show up -- many more than we ever anticipated," he said in an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on "Good Morning America" this morning. "It's a great place - New Hampshire - you know I love the people and they were reflective of it. It was a great evening."

As polls closed in the Granite State Tuesday night, ABC News projected Trump would win the New Hampshire Republican primary. And, as of this morning, Trump had garnered more than 35 percent of the vote, holding onto a nearly 20 percentage point lead over second-place finisher, Ohio Gov. John Kasich.

Trump said he expects to absorb some of the other GOP candidates' support as they exit the race.

"I'm going to get some of those votes also," he said. "A lot of them."

Of his rivals, Trump said "they're all good" but he said his message was "better than their message."

Though Trump had long been favored to win the first-in-the-nation primary, rival Ted Cruz's victory in the Iowa caucuses as well as Marco Rubio's better-than-expected finish there raised questions about the Trump campaign's organizational prowess.

"You know, we learned a lot about ground games in one week I have to tell you that," Trump said in victory speech last night, sounding a note of confidence for the primaries ahead.

"We are going to start winning again and we're going to win so much, you are going to be so happy," Trump told a cheering crowd. "We are going now to South Carolina. We're going to win in South Carolina."
