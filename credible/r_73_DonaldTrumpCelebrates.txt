In Indianapolis today, President-elect Donald Trump will tout his deal to stop nearly a thousand Carrier jobs from moving to Mexico. But at a ball bearing plant just a mile away, hundreds of Hoosiers may soon lose their jobs.

In October, the Rexnord Corp. announced it "tentatively decided" to move its Indianapolis operation to another one of its facilities, in Mexico.

Closing the plant would cost 350 workers their jobs, the union representing employees there told ABC News. The move is anticipated to happen sometime in the spring next year.

Rexnord has not responded to ABC News' requests for comment.

The president of the Indiana AFL-CIO, Brett Voorhies, started his career at Rexnord and has friends and family members who work at the plant. He told ABC News that people are happy for their friends at Carrier but wish Trump could help them too.

"It's really sad," Voorhies said. "They're looking out the window and seeing what's going on at Carrier, and they're happy for their brothers and sisters, but they're thinking, 'Why can't you do this for us as well? Are you able to save my life too, Mr. President?'"
