Story highlights Clinton called Thursday night's shooting in Dallas an "absolutely horrific event"

Clinton also warned that there was a "terrible disconnect" between police officers and the people they are meant to protect

(CNN) Hillary Clinton on Friday called for the nation to come together in the aftermath of an ambush that killed five police officers in Dallas, Texas, warning that this "absolutely horrific event" -- coupled with a series of recent shootings involving police officers -- "should worry every single American."

"This is the kind of call to action, and as president, I would implement the very comprehensive set of proposals that I've been making for more than a year," Clinton said in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. "We must do more to have national guidelines about the use of force by police, especially deadly force."

Clinton also called on communities across the country to show more "respect" to the police, as she paid tribute to the officers who risked and lost their lives in Dallas.

"Look at what happened in Dallas. Those police officers were protecting a peaceful protest ... that is a hallmark of America," she said. "And when the shooting started and everyone else was fleeing, the police were moving toward danger."

But Clinton also warned that there was a "terrible disconnect" between police officers and the people they are meant to protect. She explicitly stated that some African-Americans are dying as a result of "systemic" and "implicit bias."
