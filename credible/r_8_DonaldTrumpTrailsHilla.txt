Unable to consolidate support from steadfast Republicans and losing ground among white college-educated women, Donald Trump is trailing Hillary Clinton by double digits in a Monmouth University national poll released today.

The poll shows Clinton leading Trump, 46 percent to 34 percent, among registered voters and finds a similar margin for Clinton among likely voters.

Clinton is solidifying her backing among her party's regulars -- climbing to the support of 92 percent of Democrats, up from 85 percent in June, according to the poll. Meanwhile, Trump garners support from only 79 percent of Republicans -- exactly even with his showing in June.

Trump is losing by a wide margin among white women with a college degree, a typically Republican group. Mitt Romney won this group by 6 percentage points in 2012, but Clinton leads Trump among this group, 57 percent to 27 percent.

Another warning sign for Trump: 2 in 3 voters say Trump lacks the temperament to be president. Only 27 percent say he has the right temperament for the job -- a new low for the candidate in Monmouth's polls.

Still, voters show distaste for Clinton as well as Trump, giving both low marks in favorability. Nearly half of voters admit they are less enthusiastic than usual about this election compared with past presidential races. That's up from only 2 in 10 voters in June 2015.
