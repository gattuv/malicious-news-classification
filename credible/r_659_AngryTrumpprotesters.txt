New Orleans police were monitoring a group of about 200 anti-Trump protesters who were making their way through the French Quarter and the CBD.

Police say there have been no major incidents, but witness are sending in pictures of windows busted out at the Place St. Charles building and "F--- Trump" spray-painted on One Shell Square.

Protesters filled the streets chanting "not my president" and "no Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA" while New Orleans police blocked off streets to ensure the protest remained peaceful and protesters did not walk into traffic.

Many of the protesters were holding signs for the cause, one even advocating a coup.

Some of the protesters said this isn't about politics but instead human decency, saying in some regards they can't accept Trump's presidency as legitimate and arguing against the Electoral College.

One protester who did not vote said actions like these are only the beginning.
