Story highlights Hillary Clinton attacked Donald Trump's "fraudulent business history" during a campaign stop in New Jersey

Trump has filed four business bankruptcies in the last 30 years that relate to his casino holdings in Atlantic City

Atlantic City, New Jersey (CNN) Hillary Clinton used the backdrop of Atlantic City, New Jersey, on Wednesday to slam Donald Trump and one of his most high-profile surrogates, the state's governor, Chris Christie.

"If your governor will start doing his job instead of following Donald Trump around, holding his coat, maybe we could really get New Jersey's economy moving again," Clinton said to cheers from the crowd.

Clinton is spending time in the city where Trump developed casinos in an effort to highlight what her aides are calling Trump's "fraudulent business history."

The visit comes the same day that the campaign announced that she is updating her college affordability plan to include input she received from her primary rival Bernie Sanders. In an olive branch to unify her party in fighting Trump, Clinton will add three new features to her "New College Compact," including eliminating college tuition for working families, a step that moves Clinton closer to the tuition free college plan that Sanders ran on in 2015 and 2016.

She hit Trump for "multiple bankruptcies, stiffing contractors and spurring hundreds of job losses" during his time owning casinos in Atlantic City.
