Susan Sarandon might find herself voting for Donald Trump if Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee.

The actress revealed on Monday that Trump might be a better choice than Clinton because "some people feel Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately."

"If he gets in, then things will really explode," she told MSNBC.

When pressed on whether a Trump presidency could be dangerous Sarandon said: "If you think that it's pragmatic to shore up the status quo right now, then you're not in touch with the status quo."

The outspoken Bernie Sanders supporter said she feels Clinton is "not on the right side."

"I think that's what's going on now...the status quo is not working and I think it's dangerous to think we can continue the way we are with the militarized police forces... with the low minimum age, with threats to women's rights and think you can't do something huge to turn that around because the country is not in good shape."

Sarandon continued to say that she does not trust Clinton who has accepted millions of dollars from fracking supporters.

"You know, [she's] taken money from fracking, why do you think she's going to have your back [when elected]?" she argued. "She doesn't even want to fight for $15 minimum wage so... why would we think she going to come out now... I talk to Republicans who have written [Trump] already and just feel like [Clinton] is not authentic, that she's a liar that they don't trust her so what difference does it make?"
