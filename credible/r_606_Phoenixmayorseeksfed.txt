PHOENIX (AP) -- Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton wants the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate whether Maricopa County elections officials illegally put fewer presidential primary polling locations in poor or minority-heavy areas.

Sites across the county were jammed and lines topped five hours at some spots.

Maricopa County had just 60 polling locations for a county of 4 million during Tuesday's primary election. In 2012 there were 200 polling locations.

Stanton says in Wednesday's letter to the Justice Department that it appears rich areas like Paradise Valley and Fountain Hills had many fewer voters per polling location than Phoenix.

Stanton says that raises question of whether all voters were treated equally.



He also cited examples of other policies adopted by elections officials and the state Legislature that he says "has created a culture of voter disenfranchisement."
