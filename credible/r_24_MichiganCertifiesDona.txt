A Michigan elections panel has certified Donald Trump as the winner in the state's presidential election, according to The Associated Press.

Trump won the state by 10,704 votes -- a mere two-tenths of a percentage point -- the tightest presidential race in the state's almost 200-year history. The result pushes Donald Trump's total to 306 electoral votes to 232 for Hillary Clinton.

The Michigan State Board of Canvassers unanimously certified the election results shortly after 2 p.m. today.

Certified results from Michigan: Trump 2,279,543 (47.6%)

Clinton 2,268,839 (47.4%)

Johnson 172,136 (3.6%)

Stein 51,463 (1.1%) -- Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) November 28, 2016

This year was the first time in almost three decades that a Republican presidential candidate won the Wolverine State. Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, two other Rust Belt states that helped deliver an upset White House victory to Trump, went red for the first time in roughly the same period.

Green Party candidate Jill Stein says she plans to file for a recount in Michigan. She must file for a recount by a Wednesday deadline, and she and her party have raised more than enough money to pay the almost $800,000 required. The recount is not expected to change the state's winner, and Clinton would not win the White House even if the recount tipped Michigan alone her way.

Michigan's Republican governor Rick Snyder tweeted that there were "no ballot problems" in the state ahead of the likely recount.

No ballot problems in MI. Let's move past politics. @realDonaldTrump & @mike_pence need to focus on important job of governing. -- Governor Rick Snyder (@onetoughnerd) November 28, 2016

In the state, exit polls showed that Barack Obama won 44 percent of white voters without a college degree in 2012 but that Clinton won only 24 percent of them this year. Mitt Romney's margin of victory among this group was only 109,000 votes, versus 421,000 votes for Trump.

In addition, turnout was down 16,000 votes since 2012 in counties that Clinton won, versus up 82,000 votes in counties Trump won in Michigan.

Meanwhile, Clinton's national lead now tops 2 million votes for the first time. She has garnered 64,429,062 votes, to Trump's 62,352,375, according to the most recent numbers from The Associated Press.
