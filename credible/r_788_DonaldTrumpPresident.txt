Back Story

Brazil is celebrating an important holiday on Sunday, though it's one that may be unfamiliar outside the country: Black Consciousness Day.

Slavery existed in Brazil until 1888, making it the last country in the Americas to abolish the practice. More than five million slaves were sent to Brazil through the Atlantic trade, compared with about 300,000 in mainland North America, according to one of the most thoroughly researched academic estimates.

Today the nation has more residents of African heritage than any other country outside Africa.

The population has historically been underrepresented in government, but a rise in citizens identifying as black or mixed race is helping to chip away at economic and educational inequalities.

Black Consciousness Day was established in 2003, featuring the "Freedom Walk" -- parades around the country meant to show the size of the black population.

The date, Nov. 20, was set for the anniversary of the death of Zumbi dos Palmares, one of the great black heroes of the Americas. He led a small kingdom founded by runaway slaves. He was killed by the Portuguese in 1695, after they overran his republic.

But the power of his story has only grown as the country embraces its African roots.

A researcher with the Afro-Brazil Museum in Sao Paulo sees more progress ahead: "We Brazilian blacks are finally learning to be black."
