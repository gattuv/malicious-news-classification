Is it hot in here or is it just Lasse Matberg?

This 30-year-old Norwegian Royal Navy sports officer is making Instagram weak at the knees, one perfectly posed long blonde-haired, immaculately groomed bearded photo at a time. He's amassed more than 180,000 followers.

His profession requires him to stay physically fit, which the Internet can all agree he does extremely well.

"I'm part of a team of Sports Officers who all work towards keeping the fitness level of the Navy's Sailors, Privates and Officers up to the standards required for them to function properly as they perform their duties," he wrote to ABC News. "It's a really rewarding job, and I love that it's not just a desk job, but a job where I get to stay active and interact with new people every day."

Oh and does he stay active.

He loves being outdoors...

And of course, sporting his uniform.

Matberg's modeling career began as a "fun hobby," but has clearly been a fruitful endeavor for him which he says even earned him the unofficial title of "Beard of Norway 2015" last year.

The best part? He's single. Although some of his Instagram fans would beg to differ.

"Well, according to some of my fans, I'm already married to several of them," he joked. "I wasn't really aware of that, but I guess my invites to all of the weddings got lost in the mail or something."

The fame hasn't gone to his head, however.

"To be honest it feels really surreal," Matberg wrote of his newfound attention. "I'm extremely thankful and very much in awe of this whole deal."
