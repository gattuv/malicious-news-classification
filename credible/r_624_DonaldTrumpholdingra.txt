- Donald Trump will be returning to Tampa for another rally on Saturday, just days before the election.

The event will be held at the Florida State Fairgrounds on Saturday, November 5 at 10:00 a.m.

Trump recently held a Tampa rally on October 24-- just over two weeks ago. But in this heated election, it seems the campaign made a last minute decision to return to Tampa in hopes of securing the battleground state of Florida.
