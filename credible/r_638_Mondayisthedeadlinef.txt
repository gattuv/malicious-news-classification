- Monday is the deadline to register to vote in the Pennsylvania primary election.

Voters can register online or stop by the Voter Services office in your county of residence.

Registration can be completed online by visiting www.pavoterservices.state.pa.us and clicking on the voter registration link.

Since Pennsylvania is a closed primary state, voters will need to either be registered as Democrat to vote for either Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton, or as a Republican to vote for John Kasich, Ted Cruz, or Donald Trump.

The Pennsylvania primary election will take place on April 26.
