AT THE HERBLOCK Prize reception Tuesday evening, beneath the history of the Great Hall, attendees could be heard saying a common refrain to the political cartoonists in the Library of Congress room: Donald Trump sure must be good for business.

And at least a few artists could be heard acknowledging: Yes, indeed, he is a humorist's orange-y gold mine.

The current campaign, in fact, is yielding triple the satiric riches, as Hillary Clinton works to secure the nomination, while Bernie Sanders has vowed to stay in the race till the party convention. The result, for cartoonists taking aim, is a target-rich environment that offers all the opportunities of a shooting gallery in a 24/7 carnival zone. Perhaps the hardest part is keeping up with the fierce pace of the candidate circus.

Here is how America's satire-armed artists are training their cross-hairs:
