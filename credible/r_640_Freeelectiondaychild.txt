- The YMCA wants to make sure busy parents can can vote on Election Day.

They're offering free childcare as part of a program called "Zoe's Kids Day Out." It's an initiative to ensure kids spend time in a safe environment while their parents vote.

"Election Day is arguably one of the most important days in the U.S. this year -- the ultimate opportunity for Americans to make their voices heard through the democratic process," YMCA of the USA President and CEO Kevin Washington said in a statement. "Unfortunately, many people who want to vote find it challenging because they have to take children with them. The Y's hope is that Zoe's Kids Day Out initiative enables those parents and caregivers to exercise their right to vote, and ensures children can spend their time in a safe, nurturing environment."

Not every YMCA will offer the free service. Make sure to call your local Y and check to see if they are participating in the initiative before dropping off your kids.

At last check, only two locations in the Tampa Bay area are offering free childcare on Election Day. Other YMCA's are still making a decision.
