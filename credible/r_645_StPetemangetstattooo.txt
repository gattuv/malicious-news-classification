- A St. Petersburg man named Sean recently decided he wanted a patriotic tattoo -- something that would really stand out. So he met with an artist at Suncoast Tattoos in St. Pete Beach to draw up his idea.

"I couldn't think of anything more patriotic that a Trump tattoo," Sean -- who asked us not to use his last name -- told FOX 13 News.

But Sean didn't get a Trump-Pence campaign logo, or "Make America Great Again" in script lettering. Sean got a portrait of The Donald himself.

"Couldn't have possibly asked for a better tattoo. This is the best Trump tattoo I've ever seen," Sean said, showing off his new ink.

The tattoo artist behind the portrait is Joshua Dunlap. He owns Suncoast Tattoos, and is happy with the way the piece came out.

"I was pretty excited, honestly, from an artist standpoint," Dunlap said. "Everyone knows what Donald Trump looks like. If there's a mistake within my recreation of his face, the entire nation, the entire world will see it."

Losing to Hilary Clinton is not a concern for the tattoo's owner. He's happy to be "Trumped" for life.

"Even if he loses the election, you have a tattoo of an American icon," Dunlap offered.

"This is a movement, something completely different than what's happened before," added Sean.
