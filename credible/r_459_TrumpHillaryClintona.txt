Story highlights This is the first time Trump has raised the former president's alleged affairs since becoming the GOP's presumptive nominee

Trump did not expand upon what he believes Clinton did to "destroy" the lives of those women

Eugene, Oregon (CNN) Donald Trump on Friday accused Hillary Clinton of being "an unbelievably nasty, mean enabler" of her husband's alleged affairs and accused her of destroying the lives of his accusers.

The remarks are the first time that Trump has raised the former president's alleged affairs and Hillary Clinton's behavior amidst a flurry of accusations since becoming the Republican Party's presumptive nominee. Trump had previously accused Clinton of being an "enabler" to her husband's behavior, but he ramped up his rhetoric on Friday.

"She's been the total enabler. She would go after these women and destroy their lives," Trump said, adding, "She was an unbelievably nasty, mean enabler, and what she did to a lot of those women is disgraceful."

Trump did not expand upon what he believes Clinton did to "destroy" the lives of those women. A message left with the Clinton campaign Friday night was not immediately returned.

The brash billionaire on Friday sought to get ahead of what he believes will be an onslaught of attack ads against him, focusing specifically on sexist remarks he has made.
