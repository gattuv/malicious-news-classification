Story highlights Donald Trump used Ted Cruz's line about "New York Values" to attack the Texas senator ahead of the April 19 primary

Trump spoke in Bethpage, New York, and Cruz met with voters in the Bronx

Bethpage, New York (CNN) Donald Trump came home to New York Wednesday, speaking for the first time since being defeated in Wisconsin by primary opponent Ted Cruz, ready to make sure that the Texas senator never lives down one of his most memorable lines of attack.

"Remember when he started lecturing me on New York values like we're no good?" Trump asked his supporters, referring to Cruz's attempt to undercut Trump's socially conservative credentials ahead of the Iowa caucuses.

"I looked at him and started talking about our incredible police, our incredible firefighters," Trump said, pointing to New Yorkers' bravery after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center.

The roaring crowd of about 10,000 supporters -- per Nassau County Fire Marshal Scott Tusa's estimate -- responded in kind with chants of "U.S.A." and "Lyin' Ted," picking up on the moniker with which the brash billionaire has sought to brand Cruz.

Trump's rally drew relatively few protesters, with only two interruptions during his speech -- including one that prompted the New York crowd to begin chanting a vulgar insult at the protester. Several dozen protesters demonstrated outside as Trump supporters made their way into the rally.
