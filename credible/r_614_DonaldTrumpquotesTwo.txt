Donald Trump says his favorite book is the Bible. But don't ask him to quote from it.

Trump was invited to speak at Liberty University, Jerry Fallwell's private evangelical college in Virginia.

About 10,000 people were there, mostly students who were required to attend the convocation.

Trump had no problem talking about himself. But when it came to quoting scripture, it came out like this.

"Because I hear this is a major theme right here, but Two Corinthians, right? Two Corinthians 3:17, that's the whole ballgame. Where the Spirit of the Lord is, right? Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty," he said.

There was some laughter in the crowd afterward. The quote from Second Corinthians is well known at Liberty University as the school verse.

Despite the flub, most of the 50-minute speech was warmly received.
