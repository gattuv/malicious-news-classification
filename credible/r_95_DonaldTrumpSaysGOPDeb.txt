After skipping the most recent Republican presidential debate ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Donald Trump is back in the saddle for ABC News' forum Saturday evening, saying he expects it to be an "incredible evening."

"So many things to say, so much at stake," Trump tweeted Friday.

I very much look forward to tomorrow's debate in New Hampshire--so many things to say, so much at stake. It will be an incredible evening! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2016

Trump is set to duke it out with the six other GOP candidates who have been extended an invitation to the debate, hosted by ABC News and the Independent Journal Review in Manchester, New Hampshire. The GOP hopefuls will offer their final pitches in the Granite State ahead of Tuesday's primaries.

Trump boycotted the GOP debate ahead of the Iowa caucuses, instead holding a fundraising event for veterans. He had been feuding with the hosts, Fox News.
