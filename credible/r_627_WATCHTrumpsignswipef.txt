- Every election, political signs pop up on people's front lawns. So do reports of people string to swipe those signs. But one Indianapolis resident was ready.

The man's hidden camera video shows an attempted sign steal: A woman tries a grab and dash. It turned out into a drop and fall.

The sign was attached to fishing wire that was spray-painted green. The would-be thief dropped the sign and fell face-first in the man's front yard. She then ran off without the sign.

The resident says whether it's a Bernie, Hillary, or Trump sign, people are free to disagree with the politics -- just leave the signs alone.
