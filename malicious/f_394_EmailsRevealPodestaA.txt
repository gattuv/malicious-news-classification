The recent bombshell regarding John Podesta's "spirit cooking" ties is slightly more than disturbing, but far less than surprising.  Hillary Clinton has been letting us know for years that she has a deep disgust for God and a deeper appreciation for Satan.

How could a true woman of God do any of the horrible things she has done?  Though few have come out and said it, it is clear that many think Hillary is a satanist.  Remember Ben Carson at the RNC?

Clinton was a frequent pen pal of Alinsky, if not something more.

For those who don't know, Saul Alinsky was a known satanist who actually dedicated his book, Rules for Radicals, to Lucifer.

As we reported last year a former Clinton associate made the startling accusation that Hillary is indeed a satanist:

Back in May, video exposed Hillary cackling with glee as the words "under God" were omitted from the Pledge of Allegiance at one of her rallies.
