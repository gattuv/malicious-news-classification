The woman just can't help herself.

In what has been described as the WTF (what the fudgesicle) moment of Wednesday's debate, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton disclosed on national TV the U.S. response time to launch a nuclear attack.

And no, the moderator, Fox News Channel's Chris Wallace didn't ask her for this information. It was just something she threw in to let America know that these are the kinds of things she knows about.

To repeat a word her Republican counterpart often uses, it was "sad."

And folks on social media thought so also.

"There's about four minutes between the order being given [to launch a nuclear strike] and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so."

No one caught that Crooked Hillary stated on LIVE TV what our NUKE RESPONSE TIME IS 4 MIN??@FoxNews @DRUDGE #debatenight #ChrisWallace pic.twitter.com/QBbbmGkmeL -- John T. Miller (@cyvault) October 20, 2016

Folks on social media were astounded.

ALSO HILLARY CLINTON JUST COMMITED TREASON BY STATING THAT IT TAKES 4 MINUTES BETWEEN NUCLEAR ORDER AND NUKES FLYING -- Paul Bunyan (@americanvolkist) October 20, 2016

WE THE PEOPLE WANT CLINTON ARRESTED FOR GIVING HIGHLY SECRET NUKE RESPONSE TIME TO THE ENEMY! NOW! #wethepeople -- Rigged2016 (@Koolbreeze2467) October 20, 2016

Also, just out of curiosity, was our nuke response time known before last night? -- Joe Hudson (@jmhudson) October 20, 2016

So how secret was the information Clinton blabbed on national TV? Someone who had a TS/SCI (Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information) classification while serving in the military said he had no idea until she divulged it.

I held a TS/SCI for weapons / target tracking on a Nuke cert sub and I didn't know the US response time. (I knew ours only - need to know) -- Deplorable - PR (@ABH_AMH) October 20, 2016

And this was just the latest of many instances where she failed to guard our national secrets.

Hillary exposed secrets, told donors Bin Laden raid details and gave up our nuke response time. Sounds like an excellent choice for POTUS! -- Josh Earnst (@NotJoshEarnest) October 20, 2016

Clinton has been under fire for using an unsecured private server to handle her flood of official emails -- some containing classified information -- while she served as secretary of state.

As a possible result, at least one person may have lost his life.

Iran executed Shahram Amiri, a nuclear scientist, for spying on behalf of the United States earlier this year. His name was referred to in a July, 2010 Clinton email as "our friend."
