A postal worker from Columbus, Ohio got on Twitter to brag about the deplorable thing he does to the Trump ballots that he comes across while he is at work. "I love working at the post office in Columbus, Ohio and ripping up absentee ballots that vote for Trump," he tweeted.

Obviously, he stirred up quite a bit of outrage from Republican voters, some of which cited how what he is doing is a federal crime. Either this guy is a professional troll, or he really is just completely ignorant, as are most Liberals. One Twitter user by the name of Jackson Berger let this idiot in on a little secret: "Delay or destruction of mail or newspapers is a federal crime." Another user was right on point when they told the postal worker "I hope you get fired!"

The Twitter user ended up saying that this was just a joke, but come on... He knew he screwed up and he is probably frantically trying to cover his tracks so he doesn't end up jobless and in prison. Joke or not, it's not funny. What do you think should happen to this person?
