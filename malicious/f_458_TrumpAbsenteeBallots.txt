Are absentee ballots with votes for Donald Trump being destroyed? Someone claiming to be an Ohio post office employee is stirring up a lot of Twitter users after bragging about ripping up absentee ballots that vote for Trump.

His tweet got the attention of Trump supporter and actor, Scott Baio.

"I love working at the post office in Columbus, Ohio and ripping up absentee ballots that vote for trump," the man wrote.

The tweet didn't go unnoticed by Baio, who called out the guy and tagged Ohio Governor John Kasich in his response.

I hope you get fired! Cheating is the only way she'll win. @realDonaldTrump Hey @JohnKasich is this okay with you? https://t.co/9mgk11KZHk -- Scott Baio (@ScottBaio) October 17, 2016
