(INFOWARS) Was Hillary Clinton wearing an earpiece during last night's presidential forum? That's the latest question swirling around the Internet after pictures appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear.

Conservative actor James Woods drew attention the issue with the simple question, "Earpiece?" and a close up image of Hillary from last night's forum.

Woods also posted a Clinton email from the Wikileaks archive in which Huma Abedin asked Hillary, "Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?"
