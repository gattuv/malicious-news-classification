There has been quite a bit of renewed concern recently over the health of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, with some worrying that her potential health issues could prevent her from adequately serving as president, should she be elected.

This concern has prompted a surge in American voters demanding the release of the presidential candidates' recent medical records for the public to see, as their health, either good or bad, could conceivably play a factor in their presidency.

According to a recent Rasmussen Reports poll, some 59 percent of respondents said all major party presidential candidates should release at least their most recent medical report to the public, up considerably from just 38 percent in 2014.

Of those polled, 30 percent thought a candidate's medical records should remain private, while about 11 percent were undecided on the issue.

Surprisingly, when those numbers were broken down by party affiliation, it was the Democrat-leaning respondents who were more inclined to want medical records publicized instead of Republicans, 62 - 58 percent. Some 57 percent of unaffiliated or independent voters wanted the records made public as well.

As an aside, the latest Rasmussen poll also showed that Clinton's big "bump" in the polls after the Democrat National Convention has all but dissipated, with her only holding a three-point lead over Trump nationally, 43 - 40 percent. Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson polled at 8 percent, while Green Party nominee Jill Stein registered 2 percent support.

Interestingly, that 3-point lead held by Clinton was equal to the 3-point margin of error in the poll, meaning for all intents and purposes they were effectively tied just three months out from the election.

It remained to be seen whether this increased demand for presidential candidate's medical records to be made public will compel the Clinton camp to come clean on what health issues are obviously plaguing the Democrat nominee, as the people have a right to know how healthy the people they are considering as their next leader really are.

Please share this on Facebook and Twitter to help spread the word that a majority of voters, especially Democrats, think that major presidential candidates should publicly release their medical records before voting takes place.
