Clinton took the lead role in organizing the so-called "Friends of Syria" (aka Al Qaeda/ISIS) to back the CIA led insurgency for regime change in Syria. Under oath Hillary Clinton denied she knew about the weapons shipments during public testimony in early 2013 after the Benghazi terrorist attack. If these e-mails are accurate and true, Mrs. Clinton should be immediately removed from the Presidential ballot.

According to Redstatewatcher:

Thepoliticalinsider.com reported: In Obama's second term, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton authorized the shipment of American-made arms to Qatar, a country beholden to the Muslim Brotherhood, and friendly to the Libyan rebels, in an effort to topple the Libyan/Gaddafi government, and then ship those arms to Syria in order to fund Al Qaeda, and topple Assad in Syria.

We have reached the point, that every day another allegation surfaces about Hillary Clinton's actions. Yet nothing is ever done about it. What will it take for the House and Senate to do their jobs? There is more then enough information to disqualify Mrs. Clinton from running for the presidency. She cannot be trusted, and it is time to take action. What do you think?
