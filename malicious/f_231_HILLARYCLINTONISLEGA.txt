Hillary Clinton is legally "disqualified from holding any office under the United States" due to her violation of U.S. Code Title 18 Part I Chapter 101 Section 2071.
We demand that the United States Department of Justice act to enforce the law & indict her ending her presidential campaign & causing her to face up to three years in prison.
The full text of the law is an follows:
"Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States"
WE SIGNED: DEMAND INDICTMENT OF HILLARY CLINTON FOR VIOLATION OF 18 U.S. CODE SS 2071 WHICH DISQUALIFIES HER FROM HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE ENDING HER PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
