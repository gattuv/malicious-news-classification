Hillary Clinton is a charitable politician, as long as the money makes it way back to herself.

Last year, Bill and Hillary Clinton deducted $1,042,000 in charitable donations, but 96 percent -- or $1 million -- went to their own charity, the Clinton Foundation, according to the Daily Caller.

Clinton released her tax forms on Friday in a move that is seen as a way to pressure Donald Trump to release his taxes. The GOP nominee has refused to release the records, saying that he is under a routine audit. The documents show that the power couple earned $10,745,378 last year, mostly on income earned from giving public speeches. Of that, they gave just over a million to charity. But the contributions can hardly be seen as altruistic, since the money flowed back to an entity they control.

The other $42,000 in contributions from Clinton went to the Desert Classic Charities, an organization that holds the annual PGA golf tournament.

Back in 2012, Mitt Romney was criticized by liberal pundits for giving a majority of his donations to the Mormon Church. It's still unclear if Clinton will undergo the same scrutiny from the mainstream media.
