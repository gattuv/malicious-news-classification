Google has seen a spike in searches for "how to move to Canada" since Trump started his campaign. If Canada isn't your style, you might want to try Ireland. An island off the coast of Ireland, Inishturk, has joined Canada in inviting American refugees to come live there if Trump becomes president.

The island has experienced a decline in population over the last few years, so they are inviting Americans to join them. Mary Heanue, Inishturk's development officer, had this to say about it:

"I've heard there are quite a few people in America looking to move to Ireland and other countries if Donald Trump becomes president. I'd like them to know that we'd love to see them consider moving over here."

"Our big concern is employment and trying to encourage families to move over here because the population is declining. The island featured on an Irish TV documentary last year which gave us great publicity and a good few extra bookings. But we ended up having a terrible summer and a lot of people canceled."

What does it really take to move to another country? There's a lot to think about. You need to research where exactly you want to live. You should visit the town that you are thinking of moving to at least once before you actually move.

To get a long-term visa, you will need to enroll in school there or find a job that will take you there.









For a different route, you could apply for citizenship. The U.S. allows individuals to have dual citizenship with Ireland. You should also make sure that your U.S. Passport is up to date before you move.

It will save you some hassle if you decide to move back in the future.

You will also need to have enough money for the moving expenses, and you may want to put the things you don't need to ship in storage. Sending all of your stuff over there could get tricky.

So, if you really want to leave the country to get away from Trump, think it through and plan ahead.
