The internet is abuzz with word that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton may have been wearing a low-profile earpiece at Wednesday evening's Commander-in-Chief forum on NBC.

Photos began surfacing yesterday evening showing what looks like a tiny device inside Clinton's ear:

The below photo from Getty Images also shows what appears to be a shiny object in Clinton's ear (we've zoomed in for a closer look):

Whether the device is Clinton's own communication device, something provided by NBC, or a hearing aid is unclear. It's also unknown as to whether such a device--if it is Clinton's own--would be a violation of the rules of yesterday's Commander-In-Chief forum.

Actor James Woods took notice of an interesting detail in a 2009 memo released by WikiLeaks that might help to she light on the matter:
