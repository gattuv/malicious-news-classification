Legendary comedian Jeff Foxworthy has made it abundantly clear that he is not happy with the direction our country in heading in. He is tired of watching Obama's agenda manifest, stripping Americans of our hard-won freedoms.

"If you can get arrested for hunting or fishing without a license, but not for entering and remaining in the country illegally--you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots," he said as part of his comedy routine.

"If you have to get your parents' permission to go on a field trip or to take an aspirin in school, but not to get an abortion -- you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots," he continued.

Foxworthy has also published endorsed Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump, commenting he is terrified for our nation if Hillary become president.

"I think people are fed up with having a commander in chief that does the apology tour around the world," he concluded.
