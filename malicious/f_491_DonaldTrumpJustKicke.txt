Donald Trump's unrelenting yet unfathomably effective mission to alienate as much of the human race as possible to win a popular election stepped up a gear today - when he kicked a baby out of a rally.

An actual infant.

And its mother.

Baby cries



Trump: "I hear that baby crying, I like it!"



MOMENTS LATER



Trump: "you can get the baby outta here"

Trump initially appeared fine with the unidentified infant's wails, remarking: "Don't worry about that baby. I love babies.

"Don't worry about it. I love babies. I hear that baby crying, I like it. What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don't worry, don't worry.

"The mom's running around like--don't worry about it, you know. It's young and beautiful and healthy and that's what we want."

But only seconds later - perhaps after realising that infant could grow up into a Democrat - he turned.

"Actually, I was only kidding, you can get the baby out of here.

"That's all right. Don't worry. I, I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking.

"That's OK. People don't understand. That's OK."

Trump just kicked a mother and her baby out of his rally. He's so competitive. How dare someone there have tinier hands than him. -- Emily Volman (@emilyvolman) August 2, 2016

Trump ejecting a crying baby reminds America of a sweeter time when we didn't nominate a crying baby to be president. -- LOLGOP (@LOLGOP) August 2, 2016

What's the over/under on how long until @realDonaldTrump's supporters say the baby was paid by Hillary #Benghazi #Emails -- Paul Fischer (@tencents77) August 2, 2016

This was Trump two days ago kissing a random baby.

It's almost like he acts inconsistently.
