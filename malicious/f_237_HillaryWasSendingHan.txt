Hillary Clinton is not above cheating, lying or stealing to get what she wants.

So it shouldn't be any surprise that she is being accused of cheating during Monday's 1st Presidential debate.

Clinton was accused of cheating by sending hand signals to the moderator Lester Holt.

During the debate when Clinton wanted to signal Holt whent she wanted the floor, she rubbed her face in a manner similar to a baseball manager.

According to True Pundit she has not done this in any other debates during her career supporting the accusation that these were signals.

Watch this incredible video before passing judgement-

Author and journalist Mike Cernovich reached out to poker pros to see if Hillary was signalling Lester Holt with hand gestures during Monday's debate.

Curious. Do the poker pros like @themouthmatusow see this as a "signal" to moderator Lestor Holt. https://t.co/3uQbpbhSQe -- Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) September 28, 2016

UPDATE: AFter TGP posted this story earlier today the video was pulled on YouTube due to complaints.

I am fairly certain because of the nature of this video it was not violating any copyright agreements.

Merlin SC Distribution had the video pulled.
