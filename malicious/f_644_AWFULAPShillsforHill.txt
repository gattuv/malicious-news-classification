Hillary sure likes to put people into buckets and baskets.

Hillary Clinton called Bernie supporters and millennials a "bucket of losers" in her speech to Goldman Sachs.

"This coalition, a collection of generally under-represented, low social capital individuals has become increasingly networked and increasingly motivated. This group that our analysts are calling the ((Makes air quotes)) bucket of losers could not only be a significant force in the next election but could, on an outside percentile, even win."

The AP jumped into action and defended Hillary Clinton in their report on the Wikileaks document.

 The AP claims she was showing "empathy" when she slammed Bernie supporters as losers.
