Hilary Clinton just said that Christians must deny their Faith through the enforcement of laws, by stating that the Christian belief in being pro-life, and anti-abortion, must change, and that this should be done through laws and "political will." If Christians must change Christian teachings in regards to abortion, then what Hilary Clinton is essentially saying is that Christians must deny their Faith. Hillary Clinton, speaking at the Women in the World Summit on April 23, made the statement:

Far too many women are denied access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth, and laws don't count for much if they're not enforced. Rights have to exist in practice -- not just on paper. Laws have to be backed up with resources and political will. And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.

Notice that she says that the change of Christian beliefs is the "unfinished business of the 21st century," which means she wants to persecute Christians.

God willing, Donald Trump will vanquish this witch in the elections.

The most horrific persecution of Christians is happening right now. Christians are being killed and tortured in the most demonic and cruel ways you can imagine, and its happening in Mexico. Hundreds of thousands of people slaughtered, countless innocents forced under the yoke of the most horrific and sinister tyranny. But there is hope, for tens of thousands of Christians are raising arms and fighting back.
