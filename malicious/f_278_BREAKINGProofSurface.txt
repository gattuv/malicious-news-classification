One lie that U.S. President B. Hussein Obama has been able to keep under wraps during his entire Presidency is the issue of his citizenship status. It's no secret that most thinking people know that he was born in Kenya.

Now, we all know that you do not have to be born in the U.S. to be a U.S. citizen, and you can have your citizenship changed if you were born in a different country. However, instead of Hussein Obama legally changing his citizenship status, he's merely hidden the evidence of his true place of birth, and no major evidence has been found after he swept it all away that could prove that he was born in Kenya.

Until now...
