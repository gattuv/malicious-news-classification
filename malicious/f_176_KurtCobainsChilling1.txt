If you are a Generation X'er, then you not only know who Kurt Cobain was, your attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs were largely defined by him.

Cobain was no fan of the establishment, and it was his anti-establishment attitudes that bled out through his music. An entire generation could relate to the "woe is me" attitude of his lyrics, having grown up the latch key kids of America- watching mom and dad both work 60 hours a week to make all the payments on the boats and cars and time shares, which in the end, only led to stressful lives that would see record divorce numbers and broken homes.

In 1993, just before his death, Cobain said in an interview with a now defunct media outlet, "In the end I believe my generation will surprise everyone. We already know that both political parties are playing both sides from the middle and we'll elect a true outsider once we fully mature. I wouldn't be surprised if it's not a business tycoon who can't be bought and who does what's right for the people. Someone like Donald Trump, as crazy as that sounds."

Did you just get goosebumps? I did!
