The far left Democracy Now interviewed Assange and he pilloried Hillary Clinton!

"the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya... led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton"

Now Democracy Now is no friend to conservatives and has been in the trenches for Hillary in the past. When THEY turn on her, it is big! Does she finally go down? Time will tell.

So, those Hillary Clinton emails, they connect together with the cables that we have published of Hillary Clinton, creating a rich picture of how Hillary Clinton performs in office, but, more broadly, how the U.S. Department of State operates. So, for example, the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS, that's there in those emails. There's more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton's collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone.

While Assange launched a searchable archive for the 30,000 emails released as a result of a Freedom of Information Act request, he is also about to release the ones Hillary says she deleted!

Those emails, she claimed were only personal emails. When it comes to light that they are more about guns to ISIS, Lybia/Syria, and classified, it might be the end of her.

She claimed some of the emails were between her and Bill Clinton. The problem is that the former president never uses email. So...she lied!

Such a sad state of affairs. But what difference does it make?
