Breaking News coming from the White House. Barack Obama told that he will not leave his office, if Donald J. Trump wins the coming elections.

He also thinks to ignore the whole vote, if in case Trump is elected, just to stop him from entering the Oval Office. Obama believes he has found a loophole to keep him in charge until further notice.

"As president, I must do what I feel is in the best interests of our nation," he explained. "If the American people elected 'the Donald' then I will be forced to take whatever actions I deem necessary."

In the interview for CNN, his response was very firm and confident, that he will not in any case step out if Donald J. Trump is elected.

When Obama was asked how he plans to stop Donald J. Trump from entering the Oval Office ( if elected ) he said:

"I cannot allow him into this chair, with his finger so close to the button. The power would go to his head immediately."

If this turns out to be the wrong approach, Barack Obama has another more cruel way to stop this from happening. Probably he has a lot to lose, more than his presidency, surly there is a lot of stuff in the White House, which better Donald Trump don't see.

If needed Barack Obama will order the Secret Service to "barricade" himself in the White House, and to stop any attempt of Donald J. Trump entering.

How twisted this is? Is this even possible? Barack Obama is really scared of Donald J. Trump. There is no logical explanation for this.
