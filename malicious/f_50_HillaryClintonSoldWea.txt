Can someone explain the updated polling by Fox News. How is it possible for Hillary Clinton to be leading Donald Trump by 10%? At times, Mr. Trump is misquoted and assaulted by the Clinton friendly media, but with all the daily revelations of corruption how is it possible she is still even in the conversation? We are realizing how this is playing out, as all these new stories break the heat is turned up on Mr. Trump and Hillary stays out of the spot light until the masses forget what happened this morning. Well it will not go away, Ms. Clinton is as dirty as a baby's overnight diaper. When will the Senate and or Congress start proceedings that are meaningful?

According to Young Cons :

As revealed by Julian Assange of Wikileaks: The Hillary Clinton emails connected together with the cables that we have published of Hillary Clinton, creating a rich picture of how Hillary Clinton performs in office, but, more broadly, how the U.S. Department of State operates. So, for example, the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS, that's there in those emails. There's more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton's collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone.

How much more is there to know that for over 25 years the Clintons have been selling their office to the highest bidder no matter what relationship these countries have with the United States. I honestly believe the Clintons are all about financial gain, money, money and more money. What do you think?
