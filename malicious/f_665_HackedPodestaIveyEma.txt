Y'all need to check this email out. It's from former Bill Clinton administration official Bill Ivey to Hillary campaign chairman John Podesta.

Basically, Ivey starts out talking about John F. Kennedy Jr.'s old magazine George (remember that?) and how it was ahead of its time, centering on "celebrity politics." He goes on to convey how bad the left is freaking the flip out over Trump being a perfect example of a persona in "celebrity politics" and how Hillary simply can't live up to the notion of celebrity politics, because she's "not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold."

She's not a people person. I mean, anyone with firing synapses knows that she's not likeable. Let's get real.

Anywho, he goes on to say this:

"Money isn't all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we're off and running."

And then there's this:

var RevContentSolo = { button_text: 'Find Out More'};

Did you get that?

"And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously failing rapidly."

And that's a problem, y'all. It's a big, big problem with Democrats...because they like their people all drone-like, dontchaknow.

Wow.

If you're a Democrat and you read this, how on God's green earth do you spin it?

Oh wait - I know the answer:
