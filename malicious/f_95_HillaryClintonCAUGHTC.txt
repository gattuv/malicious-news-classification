Classic Hillary right here. She can't think on her own so she needs a bug in her ear giving her all the answers and things to say.

At last night's Commander In Chief forum, Hillary Clinton seemed to have all the answers, however misguided and backward they seemed. Well, it might be true that she did, because she cheated on those answers with what looks like an ear piece!

Here's the smoking gun, courtesy of conservative celebrity, James Woods.

But that's not all, apparently this isn't the first time this has happened. According to wikileaks, and again Mr. Woods pointing it out, Hillary has used an earpiece before to spread the lies she is so famous for.

And here's video showing it more clearly.

Was she being pre-fed the questions, how to react to them, and how to respond to them? I mean, why ELSE would you need an ear piece in an open forum? This is just more evidence to the fact that Hillary cannot be trusted, is not telling the truth, and just says whatever she's either told to or whatever will fool the American people into a false sense of safety.

Hillary Clinton MUST be exposed to this. Share this everywhere and make sure the word spreads that she will not skate by while we're around!
