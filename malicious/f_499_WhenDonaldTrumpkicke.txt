Donald Trump is many things; racist, bigoted, angry tweeter, mascot of the #NeverTrump movement, a "blue collar billionaire" (not really), among other things.

There have been many low points in Trump's historic and comical rise to become a US presidential candidate but we never thought he'd turn out to be a self-proclaimed baby hater. Especially, when he has a tonne of them already.

At a rally in Virginia, Trump was giving his usual deranged/delusional/full of mostly lies speech, when a baby started crying.

What America feels about Donald Trump.

He noticed, and like the great empathetic human being that he is, Trump quipped, "Don't worry about that baby, I love babies so...I love babies, I hear that baby crying and I like it. I like it. What a baby! What a beautiful baby. Don't worry." Trump went on with his speech but a baby is a baby, and babies cry a lot.

"Don't worry about it you know. It's young and beautiful and healthy and that's what we want..." he said to the mother. Trump started speaking again, the baby started crying again, and this time Donald blew his now famed angry, impulsive Trumpet.

"Actually I was only kidding, you can get the baby out of here." Trump then went on to make fun of the mother, basically calling her stupid.

"I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I am speaking! That's ok, people don't understand. That's ok...." he said smirking at his supporters.

The baby then issued a statement:

Trump supporters acted with calm.

Sadly for Donald, his best friend in arms and icon, Kim Jong-un's supporters weren't with him.
