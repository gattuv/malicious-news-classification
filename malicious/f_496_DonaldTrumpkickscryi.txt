(CBS NEWS) - Donald Trump asked a woman with a crying baby to leave his rally in Virginia on Tuesday.

"Don't worry about that baby, I love babies. I love babies. I hear that baby crying. I like it. What a baby, what a beautiful baby. Don't worry, don't worry. The mom's running around, like don't worry about it, you know. It's young and beautiful and healthy and that's what we want," the GOP presidential nominee declared.

Trump continued to talk for another minute, about how China has "ripped us to shreds." The baby's cries seemed to grow louder, and the GOP nominee interrupted his riff on China to say he was just kidding.

"Actually I was only kidding," he said, apparently addressing the mother. "You can get the baby out of here. That's all right. Don't worry." Trump addressed the rest of the crowd.
