96 percent of the roughly one million dollars given to charity by Bill and Hillary Clinton in 2015 was given to the Clinton Family Foundation, a tax-exempt charity controlled by the Clintons.

According to the tax return released by the Clinton campaign Friday, Desert Classic Charities received $42,000 from the Clintons while the Clinton Family Foundation received a cool million. But as the Daily Caller points out, The Desert Classic Charities in turn contributed $700,000 to the second Clinton charity, the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons' charitable work has been the source of controversy ever since the publication of the 2015 book Clinton Cash, which alleged that many of the other Clinton Foundation's big donations from foreign and domestic actors coincided with beneficial decisions by Hillary Clinton's State Department. The Clinton campaign has hotly denied those allegations as pure speculation without any evidence.

Meanwhile, The Daily Caller reports Friday that FBI has started multiple probes into the second Clinton Foundation with the help of the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York. That report comes after CNN reported Wednesday that the Justice Department had turned down the FBI's request to open a probe into the potential conflict of interest.

UPDATE (3:47 PM ET): Originally, this piece reported that the Clintons donated to "the Clinton Foundation," fullstop. However, the charitable donation went to the Clinton Family Foundation, while "the Clinton Foundation" is more commonly used in press reports to refer to controversy surrounding the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. This piece has been edited to make the distinction clearer.
