The rats are jumping ship.

Michelle Obama deletes Hillary tweets from her timeline.

Has @MichelleObama deleted her tweets for the past 3 and a half years?

Michelle deleted Hillaryas tweets back to 2013.

Your News Wire reported:

Michelle Obama has scrubbed all references to Hillary Clinton from both of her Twitter accounts as news breaks that Clinton is under two different FBI investigations involving four FBI offices.

The @FLOTUS account has been wiped clean of all traces of Hillary, and @MichelleObama, a verified page with almost six million followers, has been scrubbed all the way back to 2013.

Is Michelle performing a last minute tidy up, clearing out the clutter before the dumpster fire of the Democratic campaign finally burns out?
