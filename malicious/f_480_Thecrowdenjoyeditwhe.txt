CNN's Jason Carroll (screen grab)

Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump on Tuesday booted a crying baby from a rally in Virginia and his supporters loved it, according to CNN's Jason Carroll.

Politico reported that Trump initially told rally-goers in Ashburn that he was not bothered by the crying baby.

"Don't worry about that baby. I love babies," he said. "Don't worry about it. I love babies. I hear that baby crying, I like it. What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don't worry, don't worry. The mom's running around like--don't worry about it, you know. It's young and beautiful and healthy and that's what we want."

But he then later changed his mind and ordered the baby to be removed from the event.

Following the rally, CNN's Jason Carroll noted that Trump accepted a wounded veteran's Purple Heart, noting that he "always wanted one" and that it was "much easier" than being wounded in battle.

"Let me briefly just tell you another quick story," Carroll continued. "At one point there was a baby that was crying here in the audience, and he said, 'Oh, we love babies, they're beautiful, let him keep crying.'"

"He kept talking and then at another point, he said, 'Okay, enough with the baby. I'm done with the baby.'"

"I'm paraphrasing but the crowd laughed," Carroll continued. "They enjoyed it. Was it a bit off color? Yes. But this is what people like about this man."
