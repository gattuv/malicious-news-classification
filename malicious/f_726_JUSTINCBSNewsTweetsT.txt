Twitter users have captured what they say was a pretty interesting post from a CBS reporter that claims Hillary Clinton's staffers were resigning and that she might drop out of the race.

The alleged tweet was sent out Friday afternoon by CBS producer Hannah Chanpong:

"Source inside Clint. Camp: "Staff resigning & worries of H dropping out" after FBI release," was all it read.

The original capture of the tweet was made by user [email protected] _Trump!"

Several reporters and others have asked Chanpong repeatedly about her deleted tweet in the last 36 hours, but she has not responded.

@hannahfc @billclinton why was the last tweet about staff dropping out deleted? -- Poisoned Planet Show (@TheLinxNY) September 3, 2016

@DigitTruth @hughhewitt Note, it's been 12+ hours since the Tweet deletion. It's all over. But no denial from the CBS reporter. -- Eric Dondero R. (@DonderolibtR) September 3, 2016
