Just before the election is where we see real sparks fly, the pundits that previously endorsed one political candidate are switching sides in spectacular fashion, and it's never been more divisive and it's never been more heated.

When MSNBC's liberal mouthpiece Chris Matthews went on TV, no one expected him to skewer Hillary Clinton, but what happened on his show is too good for words, you have to see it. He calls Clinton's politics pathetic, and talks about how Donald Trump is the only one that can shake up the establishment, claiming that Clinton, previously his pick for the President, would leave things the way they are, in ruins.

Watch this and share with every American.

Amen, Mr. Matthews, Amen.
