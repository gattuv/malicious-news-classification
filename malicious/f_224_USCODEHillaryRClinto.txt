Sometimes the hard truth appears in the funniest places ... like a Law Library.

Interesting read! Wonder how many people are aware. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library - RE: Hillary R. Clinton's personal email and home-based server

Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library, Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only are Hillary Clinton's private email and server illegal, her mishandling of government property (e.g. State Department emails) "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.

For those of us who do not have the United States Code[1] committed to memory, here's exactly what it says:

"(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.

(b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term "office" does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States."

(Source: 18 U.S. Code SS 2071 - Concealment, removal, or mutilation generally)

Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States."

Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us.

Can you help hold Hillary accountable?

Pass this on, please.

The preceding post was originally written as a comment under one of our articles at another alternative news website. It shows how some of the best citizen journalism is now being performed by folks who have no formal training. As soon as we read Ralph's comment, we knew it was the scoop of the year.
