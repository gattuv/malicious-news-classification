Hillary Clinton called Trump supporters a "basket of deplorables." Well for those Bernie Sanders supporters who laughed or agreed, you might want to reconsider in light of the recent Wikileaks email release. Inside the leak, Hillary Clinton calls Bernie Supporters a "bucket of losers."

See the document for yourself.

It appears Hillary Clinton has no compassion for any human being who might be aligned with any thought of political philosophy which doesn't support her agenda. And here we are with Bernie Sanders supporting Clinton as "sell out."

This is ultimately a disturbing look into the wicked script which is Hillary Clinton's brain. Sanders folded for Clinton and the DNC's scam to kick him to the curb. His supporters didn't exactly relent immediately, to say the least, however, over the recent weeks, they've cooled off a bit on the matter proclaiming allegiance to Clinton (albeit hesitantly). However, this is awful.
