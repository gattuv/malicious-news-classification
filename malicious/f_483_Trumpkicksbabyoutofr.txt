Donald Trump lashed out at a crying baby and its mother at a Virginia rally, only minutes after he had claimed he liked the sound of its tears.

"Don't worry about that baby, I love babies," Trump said on Tuesday.

"I love babies," he continued as the crowd applauded. "I hear that baby crying, I like it."

"I like it, what a baby" he said, shooting a slightly pained expression towards the baby. "What a beautiful baby."

"Don't worry, don't worry," he said. "The mom's running around like - don't worry, don't worry about it."

"It's young and beautiful and healthy and that's what we want," he said before returning to his speech about China.

Trump lured the poor mother into a sense of security, before he changed his mind moments later and kicked the mom and child out.

"Actually I was only kidding, you can get the baby out of here," he said.

"That's alright, don't worry," he said to the likely mortified mother before addressing the room, "I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying when I'm speaking!"

"That's okay, people don't understand. That's okay."

While it makes a change from previous Trump rallies that saw protesters being banished and members of the press being roughed up, turning on a baby probably won't fare well for Trump, because, well, babies.
