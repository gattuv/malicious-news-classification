The Hill:

Donald Trump's plan to cut back the Department of Education would cost nearly a half-million teachers their jobs, a liberal think tank says.

A Center for American Progress (CAP) report issued Friday found that more than 490,000 educators -- about 14 percent of all public school teachers -- could have their positions eliminated, and students could lose access to $1.3 trillion in loans.

"A Trump presidency would devastate state and district education budgets and exacerbate inequities between the working class and the wealthy elite," said Will Ragland, campaign director at the Center for American Progress Action Fund.

The Republican nominee has said he will pursue extensive cutbacks at the Education Department.
