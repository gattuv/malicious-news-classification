Horner, of Fountain Hills, Arizona, came forward with his statement after being paid to protest at a March rally in his hometown.
"I was given $3,500 to protest Donald Trump's rally in Fountain Hills," Horner said. "I answered a Craigslist ad about a group needing actors for a political event. I interviewed with them and got the part."
Now, months later, Horner's revelation explained it was not an acting part after all. Horner told ABC News, "As for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be Hillary Clinton's campaign."
Once Horner agreed to the part, he was told to start talking up Bernie Sanders if anyone were to ask him questions about who he was with.
"The actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called 'Women Are The Future,'" he said. "It was mostly women in their 60s at the interview that I went to. Plus, all the people that I communicated with had an AOL email address. No one still has an AOL email address except people that would vote for Hillary Clinton."
The revelation was not the first time paid protestors have been speculated at political events. When SEIU members stood outside the Supreme Court to show theirs support for Health Care Reform, Joe Schoffstall of Breitbart News attempted to question citizens about Obamacare waivers being granted to unions. He did not get far, as supporters denied any speculation of waivers.
Schoffstall noted, "most union members refuse or cannot appear on camera for interviews. Instead, they direct questions to a person who is designated to speak."
Horner's statements regarding the Trump rally cannot be confirmed as true, as Horner failed to provide evidence for his claims.
If confirmed, Horner's disclosure will spark questions as to who was behind those manipulative measures to sabotage Trump's campaign. Looks as if whoever spearheaded the movement did not succeed, as Trump continues to surge in the polls.
