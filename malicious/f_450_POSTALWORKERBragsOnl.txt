An Ohio(?) man who describes himself as a postal worker bragged online this weekend about destroying Donald Trump absentee ballots.

This was posted by Twitter user Randygbub on Sunday-

He actually bragged about it!

Of course, Republican users were outraged to see this leftist brag about his criminal activity.

Actor Scott Baio tweeted this out on the alleged crime:

I hope you get fired! Cheating is the only way she'll win. @realDonaldTrump Hey @JohnKasich is this okay with you? https://t.co/9mgk11KZHk -- Scott Baio (@ScottBaio) October 17, 2016

So will authorities follow up on this?
