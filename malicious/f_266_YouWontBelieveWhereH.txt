The Clinton Foundation was the Clintons' attempt at making themselves appear to be charitable. But that's failing miserably so far. For one thing, the foundation is on the verge of being investigated by the FBI for their shady deals. Clinton just released her tax returns, and what was revealed in them will surely just bring more scrutiny.

According to her tax returns, Bill and Hillary Clinton donated over $1,042,000 to charity, something liberals are eagerly trumpeting as proof of the Clintons being generous and charitably-minded. Except there's just one problem: $1,000,000 of that went straight to the Clinton Foundation. She basically donated a lot of money to herself.

Clinton released her tax forms on Friday in a move that is seen as a way to pressure Donald Trump to release his taxes. The GOP nominee has refused to release the records, saying that he is under a routine audit. The documents show that the power couple earned $10,745,378 last year, mostly on income earned from giving public speeches. Of that, they gave just over a million to charity. But the contributions can hardly be seen as altruistic, since the money flowed back to an entity they control.

You know, if you want to be seen as charitable, Hillary, you might try not giving money to an organization that you have ownership of. But what about the rest of the money? Where did that $42,000 go?

Well, that was donated to Desert Classic Charities. Someone named Doug Band was on the board of directors through 2014. If you recognize the name, it's because he later became a senior staffer at the Clinton Foundation. He was also named in the e-mails that caused the FBI to open an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Band repeatedly asked the State Department to "take care of" important foreign donors to the Clinton Foundation... and so it makes sense as to why the Clintons threw a few dollars his way.

This isn't an example of charitable giving. It's an example of an insane level of corruption.
