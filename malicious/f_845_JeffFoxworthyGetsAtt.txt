"If you can get arrested for hunting or fishing without a license, but not for entering and remaining in the country illegally--you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots," he said as part of his comedy routine. "If you have to get your parents' permission to go on a field trip or to take an aspirin in school, but not to get an abortion -- you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots," he continued.

Jeff has also officially endorsed GOP candidate Donald Trump, claiming that he is absolutely petrified if Hillary Clinton is elected president.

"I think people are fed up with having a commander in chief that does the apology tour around the world," he finished.
