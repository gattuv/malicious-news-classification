The Clintons have proved themselves to be despicable once again. They claim to have donated just over a million dollars to charity, but what you don't know is that 96% of that money went to their own foundation. They are not charitable, they are deceiving.

The corrupt Clintons earned $10.6 million last year, but liberals will still believe Hillary is fighting for the middle class.

The couple paid an effective federal tax rate of just over 34%, with a combined tax rate of just over 43%.

However, look where the majority of the money they donated to charity actually went...

From CNBC:

Hillary and Bill Clinton released their 2015 tax returns on Friday, showing they paid $3.6 million in taxes on adjusted gross income of $10.6 million.

The release appeared to be aimed at drawing renewed attention to Donald Trump's refusal to release his own tax records.

The Clintons deducted $2.24 million last year, and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent and an effective combined tax rate of 43.2 percent. They gave 9.8 percent of their adjusted gross income to charity, according to a campaign release.

Of the the $1,042,000 the Clintons gave to charity as listed on their return, $1 million of that went to the Clinton Family Foundation. The other $42,000 went to Desert Classic Charities.

Hillary Clinton also listed $1.475 million in gross income from speaking, and Bill reported $5.25 million in gross income from speaking. No details were provided on those speaking engagements.

You caught that right?

Of the $1,042,000 the Clintons donated to charity, $1 million went to their own foundation.

Classic.
