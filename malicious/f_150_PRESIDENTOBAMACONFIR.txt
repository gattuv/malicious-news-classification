#1 BARACK OBAMA HAS SENSATIONALLY TOLD CNN'S WOLF BLITZER THAT HE WILL NOT VACATE THE OVAL OFFICE IF DONALD J. TRUMP IS ELECTED THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

The current president claims he is "fully prepared" to ignore the popular vote if it means stopping Trump, having found what he believes is a little known loophole that would allow him to remain in charge until a re-election is called.

"As president, I must do what I feel is in the best interests of our nation," he explained. "If the American people elected 'the Donald' then I will be forced to take whatever actions I deem necessary."
