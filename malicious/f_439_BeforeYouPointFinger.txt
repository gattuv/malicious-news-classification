CNN political analyst and New York Times correspondent Maggie Haberman appeared as a panelist on Friday's "New Day," where she stated that Hillary Clinton supporters started the "birther" movement-- conspiracy theories positing that President Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States and thus isn't legally eligible to be president.

Haberman says that the theories started in 2008 with supporters of Hillary Clinton's first presidential campaign-- when at the time, most conservatives were rejecting the issue

The revelation came about during a discussion of Donald Trump and the fact that Trump ally Rudy Giuliani recently stated that Trump now believes Obama was born in the U.S., a seeming reversal of his support of the "birther" movement.

Giuliani made the comments during an episode of MSNBC's "Hardball," telling host Chris Matthews:

"Donald Trump believes now that he was born in the United States, but that issue was raised originally- That issue was raised originally by Hillary Clinton's campaign."

After showing a clip of Giuliani's "Hardball" appearance, "New Day" co-host Chris Cuomo asked, "Maggie Haberman, did Hillary Clinton start the birther movement?"

Haberman then made the implication that backers of Clinton's 2008 presidential bid were behind it:

"There were some supporters of Hillary Clinton who started the birther movement. Hillary Clinton never talked about it. There was some internal memo that leaked at one point, and then it never went anywhere."

The panel discussion continued but concentrated more on why Trump has not announced the reversal of his opinion himself and seemingly had Giuliani act as a surrogate in this respect.
