VIA| Hillary Clinton allegedly suffers from a variety of health problems such as "seizures" and since flashbulbs from cameras can trigger such seizures, it appears the Hillary campaign is now using PHONY AUDIENCES inserted by "green screen" to protect Hillary from (another) public seizure!

The video below from her "rally" in Reno, NEvada on August 25, is twelve minutes but it is worth watching every second. It shows the green screen insertion point - a black line across the "set" - and also shows cellphones from within the "crowd" which are taking video of . . . . nothing. No Hillary. No flags. No cheering crowd! It's all FAKE!

Hillary Clinton is too physically ill to be President.  Her track record throughout her life proves she is too dishonest to be President.  Don't be fooled into electing someone who is so fraught with trouble.
