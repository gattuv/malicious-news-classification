Former Big Pharma insider and hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli is openly questioning the competency of Hillary Clinton after a number of videos and Clinton's own admission of a "brain short circuit" have begun fueling speculation that the soon to be 69 year old may be suffering some sort of medical condition. Shkreli insists her recent behavior "is consistent with Levodopa treatment and early-onset Parkinson's Disease."

I'm dead serious. I reviewed a number of videos and I think @HillaryClinton has early onset Parkinson's Disease. It appears she takes L-dopa -- Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) August 7, 2016 ADVERTISEMENT

Shkreli also linked this video commenting:

"The videos are clear. She has freezing gait and dyskinesia."

Shkreli later goes on to link the following Reddit thread that discusses a brain injury Clinton suffered in 2012.

In 2012, Clinton had a cerebral venous thrombosis (blood clot in her brain). The story went like this: Clinton supposedly had an intestinal infection and got severely dehydrated. She fainted, fell, and hit her head, which resulted in a concussion. A few weeks later, she was found to have a cerebral venous thrombosis (blood clot in her brain). Her doctors claimed that she was "making excellent progress" and they were "confident she will make a full recovery." Source

Allen West also wrote a piece regarding her press coverage not being allowed to film her board her private jet, which also fueled speculation over the Democratic nominee's health.

Shkreli later held a press conference via Periscope to discuss his opinion. Here is a small clip of the event.
