WIKILEAKS RELEASE : Hillary Calls For The End of The U.S. and One "Hemispheric" Government

The most frightening thing about the recent Wikileaks drop, which included excerpts of Hillary's paid Wall St. speeches is her excitement over ending the United States as we know it.

She not only embraces the globalist mentality but she actually wants to end the U.S. as we know it and replace it with a "Hemispheric Government."

No wonder Angela Merkel is her "favorite leader."

Hillary wants to turn the United States into Germany - or worse.
