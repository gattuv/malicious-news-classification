HAH! Obama is so scared of Trump that now even he has said... if Trump wins, Canada will be his new home.

Poor Canada.

Apparently, the President is "seriously considering" making this move if Donald Trump is elected the next President of the United States. He was speaking at a White House press corps when he surprisingly joined in on the immature rant we are used to hearing from Hollywood cry babies.

He launched a scathing attack on Trump calling him 'woefully unprepared' and 'unfit to be president' ... but we all know, that's not what Obama and his like are scared of. What they are scared of is someone other than a Democrat getting into office and destroying the smokescreen they have on the American people. Their lies will be exposed and their hidden dark deeds will be out for display.

During his speech he shared his "deep disappointment" with the republican party's nominee, Donald Trump. Stating that for that reason he and the first lady have begun to explore other options.

"It's something Michelle, the kids and I have discussed as a potential solution to the Donald," he said. "I have also spoken with Prime Minister Trudeau who outlined Canada's generous immigration policy for wealthy individuals, so we'll see."

That's quite bold of him to say...wow.

Up until now, the Obama's have been expected to stay in Washington DC until daughter Sasha graduates from high school. However, apparently that won't be the case if Trump is elected.

Speaking on Canada...Obama said:

"Their education system is clearly a lot better than ours anyway," he accepted, shaking his head. "Canadians would never elect someone as buffoonish and incompetent as Donald Trump, at least outside Toronto."

There you go... yet another insult on the American people. Why? Because the Americans who support Trump are deplorable, and because they don't agree with what he wants...they aren't deserving of his respect.

That's ok Obama, go to hell Canada, you won't be missed.
