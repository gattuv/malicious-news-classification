Hillary Clinton blamed Donald Trump for the birther movement on Thursday when in fact it was actually her supporters in 2008 who started the movement.

During her campaign event in Reno, Nevada, Clinton said, "Let's not forget that Trump first gained political prominence leading the charge for the so-called 'birthers.' He promoted the racist lie that President Obama is not really an American citizen, part of a sustained effort to delegitimatize America's first black president."

In April 2008 during Clinton's and Obama's hotly contested Democratic primary, anonymous emails began circulating by Clinton's supporters that said, "Barack Obama's mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy. She was not allowed to travel by plane then, so Barack Obama was born there and his mother then took him to Hawaii to register his birth."

Even after Clinton conceded the 2008 race to Obama, according to Poltifact, some Democrats chose not to unite and instead funneled their questions of Obama's eligibility to pumaparty.com (Party Unity My Ass). (RELATED: FLASHBACK: Hillary Slammed For Saying Obama Is Not A Muslim 'AS FAR AS I KNOW')

Politifact goes on to cite The Daily Beast that a Clinton volunteer and precinct captain in Texas, Linda Star was a key proponent of the birther movement.
