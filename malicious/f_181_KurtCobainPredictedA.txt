Kurt Cobain made an eerie prediction in 1993 in which he said that Donald Trump would likely become President of the United States.

Just one year before his death, Cobain noted that his generation were sick and tired of American political culture, and that a big political change was coming in the years ahead that would demolish the two-party status quo.

Cooltobeconservative.com reports:

Cobain and his band, Nirvana, basically ended the "happy metal" days of music, which included bands like Poison, Motley Crue, and Bon Jovi (though Bon Jovi has continued to thrive in the post "happy metal" music world), with a very 'woe-is-me' style of music that was rooted in self loathing and apathy.

Cobain and his generation were the latch key kids. They sat back and watched their Baby Boomer parent's generation destroy the American dream via an obsession with materialism that led to massive debt weight and usually resulted in high divorce rates. They decided they wanted nothing to do with that, and as a result, Gen X'ers, until Millennials, led the U.S. in co-habitation without marriage, single parent families, and even in what would become known as "DINKS," Dual Income No Kids.

It's chilling to note that what Cobain said about politics only a year before his death by suicide, seems to be coming to fruition.

Cobain knew an entire generation- HIS generation- was tired of the train wreck that had become American political culture, and he knew that change was coming. It would be another generation before the change he envisioned came about, and it's sad that he's not here with us to see it. But at least he'd be proud!
