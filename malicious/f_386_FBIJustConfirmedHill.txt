As it broke earlier that John Podesta and his brother were part of a weird cult involving artist Marina Abramovic called "Spirit Cooking," now through a Freedom of Information Act release, the FBI has connected Hillary Clinton to the cult as well.

In an email conversation with top aide Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton is surprised to see Abramovic in one of the emails.

Hillary Clinton and her cronies seem to all be connected to the strange Spirit Cooking cult that does a whole host of needless to say controversial things.

According to the Washington Times:

"SPIRIT COOKING WITH ESSENTIAL APHRODISIAC RECIPES" WAS RELEASED BY MS. ABRAMOVIC IN 1996, BUT THE "INGREDIENTS" CALL FOR "FRESH BREAST MILK WITH FRESH SPERM MILK" TO BE CONSUMED "ON EARTHQUAKE NIGHTS." NEW YORK'S MUSEUM OF MODERN ART CALLED IT A "COOKBOOK" FOR "EVOCATIVE INSTRUCTIONS FOR ACTIONS OR THOUGHTS." ANOTHER RECIPE CALLS FOR "FRESH MORNING URINE." THE REVIEW GOES ON TO NOTE HER FASCINATION WITH MASOCHISM AND SPIRITUALITY, ALONG WITH HER "I TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES AND CUT MYSELF" ERA AND THE "I-RUN-INTO-THINGS-WHILE-NAKED PERIOD." THE NEWSPAPER ALSO NOTES, FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES, THAT MS. ABRAMOVIC SEES HERSELF AS A MYSTIC.

Hillary Clinton cooks with sperm and fresh morning urine? No wonder she is fainting and not looking healthy! This is extremely disturbing that someone that believes this was Secretary of State.

It's not just Hillary Clinton either, both of her top cronies, John Podesta and Huma Abedin, are either in the cult or at least very aware of it.

How could we let this happen? This has to be stopped now and we can't let these weird practices get anywhere near the White House or the government.

Please share this everywhere so that we can stop this for good and not let them corrupt our country even more than they already have!
