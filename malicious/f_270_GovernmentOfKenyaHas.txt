"There is something on that birth certificate that he doesn't like." That was one of the many quotes from frontrunner and Presidential Candidate Donald Trump, about Obama's mysterious and sketchy past and of course where this guy was actually born, and those persistent rumors of two different identities and Social Security numbers.

Perhaps after almost 8-years in office the answer as to who the man sitting in the Oval Office is, may actually be revealed.

According to reports, the Office of the Principal Register of the Nyanza Province in Kenya has just released 11 documents concerning Barack Obama's birth and early childhood in the country.

The papers have been requested by Americans for years, but the Kenyan Supreme Court finally just ordered authorities to release the documents based on a law on "access to information."

The papers indicate that Obama was actually born in Lamu, Kenya, more than a year before his father moved to Hawaii and met his mother.

This information contradicts all the documents presented by the administration over the past few years.

If the documents are deemed verifiable, they could prove that Obama had no legal right to become the American president in the first place. It also means that the American papers we've seen are all forged documents.

Moreover it seems that once again "The Donald" is correct!
