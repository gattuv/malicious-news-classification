Last week, FBI Director James Comey announced that he was reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. Now, FBI sources claim Clinton will be indicted as early as 2017.

Comey's letter to Congress noted that the FBI had discovered "new emails" pertinent to the earlier investigation on "several devices."

Reports indicate that one phone device belongs to Anthony Weiner, while the other belongs to his estranged wife Huma Abedin.

Sources inside the FBI have confessed to reporters there are "smoking gun" bombshells on the devices and she could be facing time behind bars.

Watch the video below and tell us what you think. Is Hillary clearly unfit to be president of this country?
