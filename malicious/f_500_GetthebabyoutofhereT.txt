It appears we can now add babies to the list of people that Donald Trump has banned from or kicked out of his rallies.
The controversial Republican presidential candidate was speaking at a rally in Ashburn, Virginia when a crying baby interrupted his speech.
Video shows him apparently reassuring the baby's mother that it was OK for her to stay in the rally.
"Don't worry about that baby, I love babies," he said midway through his speech.
"I hear that baby crying I like it. What a beautiful baby. Don't worry, don't worry. It's young and beautiful and healthy and that's what we want."
He then continued speaking about China, but was once again distracted by the crying baby.
This time he had changed his tune.
"Actually I was only kidding, you can get the baby out of here," Trump told the mother to laughs from the audience.
"I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking. That's OK. People don't understand."
It is unclear whether the mother and baby were removed from the rally, but earlier during Trump's speech his security team had removed several silent protesters.
The Independent reported Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine used the encounter to poke fun at the controversial Republican candidate.
"I saw that Donald Trump kicked a crying baby out of an event earlier today ... sometimes you wonder who the baby is," he said.
Trump came under fire this week for insulting the family of a Muslim soldier, US Army Captain Humayun Khan, who died in Iraq after they questioned what sacrifices he had made for his country.
He also suggested the soldier's mother, Ghazala Khan, had be prevented from speaking when her husband, Khizr Khan, spoke during the Democratic National Convention.
