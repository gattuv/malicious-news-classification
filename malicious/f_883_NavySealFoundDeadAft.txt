WikiLeaks has released a batch of emails revealing that Hillary Clinton was involved in a plane crash that caused her brain injury and left a US Navy Seal dead.

According to the WikiLeaks document, Hillary was in a C-12 Hurson aircraft that was forced to make an emergency landing at Ahwaz International Airport on the border between Iran and Iraq. The crash landing left the former Secretary of State "unconscious and bleeding profusely".

Truthfeed.com reports:

The report indicates that Hillary was on some sort of secret mission and traveling with the members of Seal team 4. One of the members of that team was reportedly killed when the aircraft crash-landed.

The government had previously claimed that Commander Job W. Price died of a possible "suicide." His death was listed as a non-combat related injury. Commander Price was a leader of this highly specialized American Special Forces unit. Their mission was to protect high-ranking diplomats traveling in Middle Eastern and Asian combat zones.

US military flight logs recorded by Russian air and space forces confirm that Commander Price, and other members of US Navy Seal Team 4, left their base in Urozgan Province, Afghanistan on a flight to US Naval Support Activity Bahrain where they met up with the then-Secretary of State, Hillary, and all of them transferred to the C-12 Huron and proceeded to fly to Baghdad.

Within minutes of leaving Bahrain airspace, the C-12 Huron carrying Hillary and her US Navy Seal protectors, "without notice," deviated from their assigned flight path for unknown reasons.

They then headed directly towards Iran's Ahwaz International Airport. Coincidentally, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had previously landed on an "unscheduled" visit.

If true, this would explain the strange "fall" and the extent of her serious and lingering injuries, being far more serious than the earlier reported "concussion."
