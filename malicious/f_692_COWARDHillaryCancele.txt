Perhaps what just took place at a Clinton rally on Sunday is finally that point-of-no-return for some Clinton supporters, when their own moral code butts up against their own ideology, and they finally acknowledge that they can no longer betray their own principles of honesty and decency, or at least we hope so.

No doubt there are still blissful supporters, suspending perhaps their own principles and making excuses for corruption and incompetence, and perhaps we even know a few, good people caught up within a perverse Ideology, masked as Utopia.

Moreover what seems obvious is that the "drip, drip, drip" of corruption has finally awakened those in attendance at Clinton's last public event of the day, and just as she was about to go on stage, a low and continued chat began to grow louder and louder until it became a unified raw of "LOCK HER UP, LOCK HER UP, LOCK HER UP!"

The surprise incident took place on Sunday in Pompano Beach, Florida, when Clinton was just about to walk to the podium within the Pompano Beach Amphitheater, when the low and at first indistinguishable chat began, along with visible Trump signs waving in the background.

Perhaps it's these new discloses and additional revelations of pay for play corruption, or the Anthony Weiner emails, or perhaps Huma Abedin, or maybe Donna Brazile feeding Hillary questions at a CNN Town Hall debate.

Or it could be perhaps Clinton supporters finally doing a little background check and finding out some additional dated issues like: China-gate, Travel-gate, the Whitewater Scandal, Vince Foster's death, File-gate Scandal, the Cattle-Futures Miracle, Drug Dealer Donor Scandal, Ponzi Scheme and Political Favor Scandal and of course Benghazi.

Check out the chants that Hillary got a full dose of:
