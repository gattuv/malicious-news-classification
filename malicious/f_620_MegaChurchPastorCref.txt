I've got one question as I search for blood pressure medicine that I'm not even prescribed. How big was the check Creflo Dollar, how big was the check? I guess Creflo caught so much flack for trying to buy a personal jet with the church's money that he took blood money from Donald Trump to come out and publicly endorse this man in the name of God. In the words of Miss Shirlene, "this ain't the work of the lord".

"God came to me in a dream last night and said that Trump is his chosen candidate," Dollar said. "God apologized for the mixed messages he was sending. I now know that Trump has been touched by the hand of God."

No self respecting Black man who is charged with the the responsibility of guiding thousands upon thousands of souls to salvation could ever sit back and say voting for Donald Trump is in the best interest of Black people as a whole. Voting for Donald Trump is definitely in the best interest of Creflo Dollar because of the tax bracket he falls in, and the fact that his tax bracket exempts him from many of the perils that every day Black folks face. Despite the fact that Creflo is leading his congregation straight to hell, so many of you devoted believers are going to run y'all ass right back in the church house this Sunday and give this bitch y'all money. Don't believe me, go visit Eddie Long's church, New Birth!

Thoughts?
