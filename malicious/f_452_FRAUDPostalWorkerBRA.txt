Some complete moron on Twitter was bragging about being able to rip up "absentee ballots that vote for Trump" since he works for a post office in Ohio.

Apparently, either "Raandy" doesn't know he's breaking the law or he doesn't care.

Probably both.

googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-0'); });

It's because of people like this guy that America is in decline.

googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-0'); });

Raandy doesn't respect the rule of law, and hopefully he'll wind up paying for it.

googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-1'); });

Such a Democrat move.

He doesn't agree, so he throws a tantrum to get his way.

Awfully child-like.

Trump supporter Scott Baio's response...



I hope you get fired! Cheating is the only way she'll win. @realDonaldTrump Hey @JohnKasich is this okay with you? https://t.co/9mgk11KZHk -- Scott Baio (@ScottBaio) October 17, 2016

Other reactions, plus Raandy's replies...



@randygdub @drewtoothpaste that's a federal crime. You're claiming its legal so you most be lying for attention, or extremely stupid. -- Jackson Berger (@Jackson_Avenue) October 16, 2016



@Jackson_Avenue @drewtoothpaste no, it's legal -- raandy (@randygdub) October 16, 2016



@randygdub How do you know they are voting for Trump aren't they sealed? If so, then you're admitting that you open people's mail? -- Deplorable Lisa (@matthewsmommy35) October 17, 2016



@matthewsmommy35 yeah but you can do that if you work at the post office -- raandy (@randygdub) October 17, 2016



@randygdub So you're taking people's right to vote away from them?? -- Deplorable Lisa (@matthewsmommy35) October 17, 2016



@matthewsmommy35 no just trump voters -- raandy (@randygdub) October 17, 2016

So now what, Raandy?

The people whose ballots you tampered with don't get a vote, but you're free to support the most corrupt politician of her era?

Guess he's never heard of electoral fraud, or the penalties in his state.

This is how Dems win.

Voter fraud is key.
