Hillary Clinton could care less about the security of the United States of America. She not only criminally handled classified information over her private server, last night she revealed America's nuclear response time to the world. She said it takes "4 minutes" to launch a nuclear bomb. Think our enemies can use that information?

Hillary Clinton can't seem to keep any classified information to herself. In a constant arrogant attempt to sound informed and intelligent, she either writes it or speaks it. She's as bad as Joe Biden pointing to the military person carrying the nuclear suitcase and letting everyone know who he was. Actually, she's worse.

Even if something is "widely reported" public officials are (supposed to be) prohibited from confirming that information. America's nuclear response time is highly classified, "top secret" information.

This should put to rest any question as to who is more dangerous regarding our nukes: Trump or Hillary. The obvious answer is Careless Hillary who throws around classified information like her own personal treasure trove of knowledge.

Was the nuclear response time of "4 minutes with an inability to cancel" that Hillary mentioned tonight classified by any chance? #debate -- Alcoholic (@austin_klavins) October 20, 2016
