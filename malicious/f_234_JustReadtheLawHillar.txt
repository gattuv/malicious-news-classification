If someone were to ask you if there is a law that Hillary has broken that should end her campaign for president right now, you'd probably answer that the laws broken by Hillary are innumerable.  But could you mention a specific law?  Well, now you can, and it was hidden in plain sight. If we laypersons can figure it out, it sort of makes you wonder what the FBI was doing when investigating Hillary's email server.

So here's the one law you need to know that should terminate her presidential campaign:

For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:"(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term "office" does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States." Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States."

So, yes, it really is that simple.  Hillary is "disqualified from holding any office under the United States."  So the only question left really should be, who is going to replace her on the Democrat ticket?
