A protester has finally come forward to tell the truth about the protests. He claims he was paid $3,500 by the Hillary campaign to crash Donald Trump's rally:

Fountain Hills, AZ -- For weeks, rumors have circulated the web that individuals were being paid to protest at rallies held by Presidential hopeful, Donald Trump. Today a man from Trump's rally on Saturday in Fountain Hills, Arizona has come forward to say that he was paid to protest the event.

"I was given $3,500 to protest Donald Trump's rally in Fountain Hills," said 37-year-old Paul Horner. "I answered a Craigslist ad a little over a week ago about a group needing actors for a political event. I interviewed with them and got the part."

Trump supporters have been claiming for weeks that the protesters are being paid for by Bernie Sanders' campaign, but Horner disagrees.

"As for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be Hillary Clinton's campaign," Horner said. "The actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called 'Women Are The Future'.
