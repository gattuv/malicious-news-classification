After a tumultuous week in the Presidential election Julian Assange has released another bombshell.Wikileaks has released a group of photos allegedly hacked from John Podesta's emails showing presidential candidate Hillary Clinton grabbing a man's crotch.

"You can clearly see",Assange told a French news outlet,"Hillary has grabbed on the man's balls.All Donald Trump has done is talk about grabbing women and they call him a rapist.They tried the same thing with me.Look,tripping on the rug and your fingers acciden1tally winding up in a woman's coocoo is not rape.What Clinton did is."

On The Kelly File Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson told Megyn Kelly that this was proof of the Clinton's deflection of their own sexual habits on to Donald Trump.

"We have a picture all the Clintons have is dozens of women all making things up so they can be guests on CNN.",Peirson said,"Donald has always been a gentleman with me and has assured me that every time his hands wound up on my genitals it was an accident."
