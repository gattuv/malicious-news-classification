Wow, she's soooo generous. Wait, does that even QUALIFY for a tax credit?

Little Miss "where are your tax forms" has some explaining to do herself!

96 percent of the roughly one million dollars given to charity by Bill and Hillary Clinton in 2015 was given to the Clinton Family Foundation, a tax-exempt charity controlled by the Clintons. According to the tax return released by the Clinton campaign Friday, Desert Classic Charities received $42,000 from the Clintons while the Clinton Family Foundation received a cool million.

As for those blocked probes? The FBI has now started multiple probes into The Clinton Foundation, as reported by LawNewz.
