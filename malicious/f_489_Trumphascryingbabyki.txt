ASHBURN, Va. -- Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had a woman who was holding a crying baby to leave a rally on Tuesday.

At first, Trump said that he did not mind the interruption.

"Don't worry about that baby. I love babies," Trump said after hearing the baby crying. "Don't worry about it. I love babies. I hear that baby crying, I like it. What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don't worry, don't worry. The mom's running around like -- don't worry about it, you know. It's young and beautiful and healthy and that's what we want."

Trump then went back to his speech only for the baby to make more noise.

"They have ripped us to shreds, ripped us absolutely to shreds," Trump said of China.

He then turned back to the woman with the child.

"Actually, I was only kidding, you can get the baby out of here," he said to laughter and applause. "That's all right. Don't worry. I, I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking. That's OK. People don't understand. That's OK."
