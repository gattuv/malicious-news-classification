We've been told for years that Hillary Clinton "fell" and suffered a concussion, which led to brain clots.

According to a report released by Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton was in a C-12 Huron aircraft that made an emergency landing at Ahwaz International Airport on the border of Iran and Iraq, skidding off the runway and crashing, leaving Clinton "unconscious and bleeding profusely" according to the report.

Also, according to the report, Clinton was on a secret mission.

Clinton was traveling with members of Seal team 4 (one of whom was reportedly killed in the crash, Commander Job W. Price, who the government claimed died of a possible "suicide," but listed his death as a non-combat injury").

If true, this would explain the strange "fall" and the extent of her serious and lingering injuries, being far more serious than the earlier reported "concussion."
