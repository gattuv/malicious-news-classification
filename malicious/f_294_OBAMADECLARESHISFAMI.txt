There is one thing that Obama declares about Trump we are actually looking forward to!
For the first time ever, the current president admitted that he would consider moving to Canada if and when Donald Trump gets elected president in November.
The Ipsos poll, stated that 19 per cent of American respondents would "consider moving to Canada" in the same case scenario.These figures elevated among young respondents: 28 per cent age 18-34 would start thinking about moving.
But it's not just disgruntled anti-Trump supporters who would consider making the leap to the Great White North.
Fifteen per cent of respondents say they would consider moving if Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton became the next U.S. President. The number was higher among men as 19 per cent said they would consider immigrating.
The idle "Move to Canada" threat has appeared in previous election cycles, or in other cases like the adoption of gay marriage in all 50 states.
Julia Clark, a senior vice-president and pollster with Ipsos, says while people don't necessarily move following elections the threat gets at the heart of the anger on both sides of the political aisle in the U.S.
"I think it's a great question because what it really does is it gets under the skin of sort of the anger and the trepidation that the public is feeling about this upcoming electoral cycle," said Clark. "Republicans are very concerned about Clinton and Democrats are concerned about Trump."
"I think it's a very tongue-in-cheek question but it gets at a very serious issue."
