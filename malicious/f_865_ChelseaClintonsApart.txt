Hillary Clinton's unexpected visit to her daughter's NYC apartment after collapsing from pneumonia this weekend was actually a secret visit to a discreet medical facility.

The Democratic nominee detoured to daughter Chelsea Clinton's alleged apartment after collapsing during the September 11 memorial service in New York on Sunday.

However, the address she was filmed entering turns out to be a secret hospital that may have treated her for a more serious neurological problem.

Pharmaceutical billionaire, Martin Shkreli, who lives nearby, was the first to point out that the address Hillary visited was actually home to a "health center".

Republican nominee Donald Trump weighed in shortly after, claiming that Chelsea Clinton no longer lived at the address that Hillary was seen entering.

Folks, does this look like Hillary? Rumor has it Chelsea moved away from that location years ago #HillarysHealth pic.twitter.com/MSBj8qBxGV -- Truth Bombers (@Truth_Bombers) September 12, 2016

How likely is it that a Presidential candidate would be shoved unconscious by the SS into a van, and then rushed off to her daughters $11 million dollar apartment?

Chelsea's apartment address is:

THE WHITMAN

21 East 26th Street, 4th Fl

New York, NY 10010

That address is shared with:

METROCARE HOME SERVICES, INC.

21 East 26th Street, 4th Fl

New York, NY 10010

Same address, same floor, with apparently only one apartment per floor.

Hillary Clinton is notoriously evasive about her medical history and is known for avoiding hospitals.

Could it be that Hillary purchased this very expensive apartment in 2013 under the guise of giving it to her daughter Chelsea, whilst actually intending to use it as a secret private medical facility during her presidential campaign to evade the press?
