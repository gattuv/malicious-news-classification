Remember when Rand Paul drilled Hillary Clinton on whether she knew about arms being shipped to jihadists? That was a classic moment because her response was a well scripted look of attempted ignorance. If you know Hillary, you know in this moment she was lying her a@@ off. It's epic...check it out:

HILLARY LIES THROUGH HER TEETH WHILE UNDER OATH:



Julian Assange spoke with Democracy Now and revealed that e-mails obtained by Wikileaks tell about arms shipments to Syria: So, those Hillary Clinton emails, they connect together with the cables that we have published of Hillary Clinton, creating a rich picture of how Hillary Clinton performs in office, but, more broadly, how the U.S. Department of State operates. So, for example, the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS, that's there in those emails. There's more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton's collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone.

You would think our Republican Congress would push harder on this but who knows if people like former congressman Mike Rodgers (MI) might have been involved in the arms shipments. It has been reported that he had involvement in this.

The key thing in all this is that it reveals Hillary to be totally incompetent as Secretary of State. It would also be nice if she was prosecuted for perjury...I'm not holding my breath.
