Mike Pence, Donald Trump's vice presidential running mate, said he no longer wants to be called a vice presidential candidate.

The Indiana governor explained he opposes the word "vice" on religious grounds. Pence said in the Bible the word "vice" means immoral or wicked behavior.

Of course in the dictionary on planet earth, the word vice means "as a substitute for," coming from a Latin root predating the Bible but whatever.

"That's not who I am, and that's not who I want people to think I am," Pence continued to explain because not everyone in the room was ready to consider him a full-on a*shole just yet.

"I can't in good faith willingly condone a word I find deplorable without violating my Christian principles."

Pence often describes himself as "a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order."

But Pence's demonic critics say he uses the Bible to justify his intolerance for gays but ignores scripture when it comes to feeding the hungry, comforting the persecuted, and helping the needy.

A reporter reminded the Indiana governor he cut tens of thousands of people off food stamps in 2014, saying "The Bible says that the Lord helps those who help themselves."

When reminded of Jesus' message of love, and how Jesus himself fed the poor, Pence responded that what he said was "in the Republican Bible."

SUNDAY CHRISTIAN BONUS: Mike Pence also said his role model for the "vice" presidential job is Dick Cheney. "I frankly hold Dick Cheney in really high regard in his role as vice president and as an American," Pence said on ABC's "This Week."
