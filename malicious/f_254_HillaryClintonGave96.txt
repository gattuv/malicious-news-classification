Given that the FBI is about to launch an investigation of the shady deals with the Clinton Foundation, I don't think Queen Hillary want this publicized too much. Which means we all should shout it from the rooftops (or on Facebook. Whichever will reach more people).

According to this, Hillary Clinton's newly released tax returns show that she and Bill donated $1,042,000 to charity. But $1 million of that went to their very own non-profit Clinton Foundation (aka Hillary's Campaign Slush Fund) -

Hillary Clinton and her husband Bill deducted $1,042,000 in charitable contributions last year -- $1 million of which went to their own family non-profit, the Clinton Foundation.

Clinton released her tax forms on Friday in a move that is seen as a way to pressure Donald Trump to release his taxes. The GOP nominee has refused to release the records, saying that he is under a routine audit.

The documents show that the power couple earned $10,745,378 last year, mostly on income earned from giving public speeches. Of that, they gave just over a million to charity. But the contributions can hardly be seen as altruistic, since the money flowed back to an entity they control.

Um, Hillz... I don't think you can write off contributions to your personal slush fund as "charity." But whatever - you're Hillary Clinton. The rules don't apply to you.

As for the other $42,000? That went to Desert Classic Charities, which is an organization that's features Doug Band on their board of directors through 2014 (he later became a senior staff member of the Clinton Foundation). Band, if you recall, was implicated in the Clinton Foundation scandal thanks to a series of emails that are currently fueling the FBI's investigation of corruption in the Clinton Foundation.

Yep. The Clintons are SOOOOO charitable. To themselves.
