WikiLeaks: Podesta May Have Attended Occultic Spirit Cooking Dinner

WikiLeaks released an email this week indicating that Tony Podesta and his brother, Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, may have attended an occultic "spirit cooking" dinner by blood-obsessed performance artist Marina Abramovic.

In an email invitation to Tony, Abramovic confirmed his attendance to her dinner and inquired about John's attendance.

Spirit cooking often incorporates human elements--particularly blood, breast milk, urine, and sperm--in ritualistic cooking. Its origins are found in Cake of Light, a supposedly spiritual food whose ingredients include honey, oil, menstrual blood and sperm.

In a Reddit forum, Abramovic told users the context of the ritual depends heavily on intention. Performing it in a gallery or studio makes it art, while performing it in the confines of one's home makes it more intimate and spiritual.

The email indicates that Abramovic planned to host the Podestas at her home.

A video taken in Italy in June 1, 1997 shows some of Abramovic's blood rituals, in which she demonstrates spirit cooking and the ingredients involved in it.

"With a sharp knife, cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand and eat the pain," she says, painting in blood on the off-white wall of her gallery, beside a mummy-like stone figure resting on the wall.

Other messages painted in the same manner include "Fresh morning urine sprinkle over nightmare dreams" and "Mix fresh breast milk with fresh sperm milk. Drink on earthquake nights."

After each message is painted on the wall, Abramovic pours the rest of her bucket of menstrual blood onto the stone figure and the edges of her studio floor. Upon the conclusion of the ritual, a man puts his head to rest against a rock suspended from the wall of the blood-filled gallery (video below).

It is still unclear whether John planned to attend Abramovic's home-cooked dinner with his brother.
