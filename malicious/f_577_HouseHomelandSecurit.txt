If God forbid she does become president, then her priority will not be the security of the country and the safety of Americans: her priority will be making sure that she gets whatas hers, regardless of what happens to everyone else. If you need to consider the possible consequences of such behavior, consider what happened after she mishandled classified material on her private email server.
