Scrolling through my Facebook feed tonight, I happened upon a link to Wikileaks via my friend Kimberly Morin. It looked intriguing, so I clicked on it to see what this email to John Podesta said.

It's from March of this year. A guy named Bill Ivey was worried that the people are going to get behind Trump and that might make it difficult for Clinton, especially if she goes full policy after the primaries.

What I found stunning was this line right here:

That is incredible.

So incredible that I wondered if it was fake. After all, how many bogus websites have popped up this election. But this is on Wikileaks official website. You can read it here.

So then I thought, "Maybe this is a fake email. A plant. Maybe Bill Ivey isn't even a real person."

Nope. He's real. And he's connected to the Clintons and the Obamas. From his bio at GlobalCulturalStrategies.com, "the online representation of the ideas, writings, and affiliations of author/consultant Bill Ivey,"

From 1998 through 2001 Ivey served in the Clinton-Gore administration as Senate-confirmed chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, and in that capacity is credited with both increasing the agency's budget and restoring good relations between the NEA and Capitol Hill. Bill Ivey is a trustee of the Center for American Progress, and was a Team Leader in the Barack Obama presidential transition.

He says "we've," not "I've."

In my mind, I'm seeing an admission of an effort to create a citizenry that doesn't understand government, their rights and is basically like a bunch of zombies on "The Walking Dead," following whatever shiny object happens to be dangled in front of them, even if it leads them off a cliff. This has been a belief by many, but until now, it's just been a belief. I don't think I've ever seen it espoused by a leftist in such plain, deliberate terms.

Final thought - a quote from Thomas Jefferson: "An educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free people.
