Oh lah-die-freaking-dah, Hillary Clinton, you thought you were being so clever when you attacked Donald Trump as the founder of the Obama birther movement. Looks like you forgot 1 huge thing...

The 2008 Hillary Clinton campaign FOUNDED the birther movement to try and discredit Obama!

Yep, Donald Trump was right once agaian...

You see, James Asher, the Washignton editor for Injustice Watch and former McClatchy Washington Bureau Chief, tweeted something game changing right after Hillary went on her INSANE Twitter rant.

According to Asher, Hillary Clinton's best buddy, Sidney Blumenthal, was actually the one feeding the "Obama was born in Kenya" lie to media around the country personally!

@HillaryClinton So why did your man #sidblumenthal spread the #obama birther rumor to me in 2008, asking us to investigate? Remember? -- James Asher (@jimasher) September 16, 2016

#CNN says #Hillary team in 2008 never raised #birther issue. #SidBlumenthal, long-time #HRC buddy, told me in person #Obama born in #kenya -- James Asher (@jimasher) September 16, 2016

So, basically, Hillary Clinton DID start the birther movement secretly to try and beat Obama, which she failed miserably at.

I smell rats here, and their names are Blumenthal and Clinton. She is a lying, theiving war criminal who should frankly be banned from ever setting foot in Washington DC again. (H/T - Mediaite)

The mainstream media is even taking her side despite knowing that she is lying! That's why ew need to PERSONALLY make sure this truth is share all over Facebook so people can see that Trump is telling the truth AGAIN!

Don't you want your children to grow up in a country without the fear of being murdered by a Clinton?
