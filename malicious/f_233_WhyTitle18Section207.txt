You will not see the mainstream media report this as they will try to paint Hillary's email problems in as benign a light as possible.

The truth is that Hillary supporters have reason to be panicked and afraid.

The State Department has already found wrongdoing on the part of Hillary. If she is now convicted Title 18. Section 2071 of the United States code should disqualify her completely from ever holding office again, and put her behind bars.

The big question is. How high does the Clinton "above the law" influence go?

Will Hillary be able to convince Obama and other high-level influencers to ignore her crimes, protect her and simply look the other way?
