If anyone's going to throw a "Trumper-tantrum" at a Donald Trump rally, it's going to be him.

The GOP nominee booted an audience member and her baby from his campaign rally in Ashburn, Virginia, on Tuesday after the infant cried over his speech, Politico reported.

At first, Trump appeared not to mind the fussing baby. "Don't worry about that baby. I love babies," he said. "Don't worry about it. I love babies. I hear that baby crying, I like it. What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don't worry, don't worry. The mom's running around like - don't worry about it, you know. It's young and beautiful and healthy and that's what we want."

But he changed his mind just moments later as the baby continued to cry.

"Actually, I was only kidding, you can get the baby out of here," the Republican nominee said to laughter and applause from the crowd. "That's all right. Don't worry. I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking. That's okay. People don't understand. That's okay."
