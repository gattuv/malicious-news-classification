Recently, a postal worker in Ohio bragged on Twitter about destroying absentee ballots for people who voted for Donald Trump. The poster, "raandy," must have either an extremely low brain cell count or doesn't work at the post office.

What makes our country special is, the United States offers us the freedom to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. We also have freedoms to speak our minds and elect a president every four years.

On the other hand, it is not legal to delete 30,000+ emails from a private server that threatened national security. In addition, voter fraud and election rigging is at an all time high. And, they are also illegal. Tampering with absentee ballots is illegal.

Although, Raandy may just be another Democratic operative trying to "birddog" Trump supporters. Nonetheless, raandy's tweet got reported. Isn't that sweet?
