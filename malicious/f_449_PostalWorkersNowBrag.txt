Good grief what are we...little grade schoolers? Actually, grade schools have more decency then those from the left that are going all out crazy right over Trump.

It's like they've lost all sense!

You're not going to believe this...

Actor Scott Baio tweeted this out on the alleged crime:

I hope you get fired! Cheating is the only way she'll win. @realDonaldTrump Hey @JohnKasich is this okay with you? https://t.co/9mgk11KZHk -- Scott Baio (@ScottBaio) October 17, 2016

This is a crime, do you think authorities will take it as such and look into this? It seems there is no such thing as a conscious anymore among these far left cheats. If this is true and this man really was stupid enough to throw away ballots that belonged to other Americans...he better pay the consequences for being such an idiot.

He has no right.
