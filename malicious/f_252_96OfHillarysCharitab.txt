Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign on Friday released her 2015 tax return, which showed that she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, donated roughly 9 percent of that year's income to charity, around $1.1 million.

While that may sound generous to some, it was pointed out by Mediaite that about 96 percent of that total went to one particular "charity," where of course the donation was written off by the Clintons on their personal income tax return.

The charity in question? None other than the Clinton's own Clinton Foundation, a tax-exempt charity that has been alleged to be little more than a money-laundering slush fund to be used for the enrichment of the Clintons and their friends and allies.

Though some of the money donated to and raised by the foundation does go toward actual charitable work, there have been numerous reports detailing the rather extensive and exorbitant overhead costs and salaries of the foundation's employees.

In fact, some charity raters and watchdog groups have struggled to give a clear picture of the foundation's actual charity work or give it a proper rating because the foundation has an atypical business model far different than the vast majority of other charitable organizations.

This on top of countless allegations of major donations from foreign businesses and leaders, who are alleged to have received favors in return from the Clinton's and the U.S. government during her tenure as secretary of state in what strongly resembles a "pay-to-play" scheme.

So, in summation, the Clintons donated $1 million to their own tax-exempt charity, which was written off of their personal taxes and which wasn't taxed as part of the foundation, which was then used to pay for their own travel expenses and the bloated salaries of their friends.

Seems all a bit clever, but what do we lowly peons know about the struggles of the elite, their taxes and their "charitable donations" from one pocket to the other?

Please share this on Facebook and Twitter so that everyone can know that nearly all of the Clinton's charitable donations in 2015 went to their own questionable charity.
