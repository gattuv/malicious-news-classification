The Clinton Foundation has been shown time and time again to be a slush fund used to peddle political influence but here's a new twist you may not have heard about.

The Clintons make sizable charitable donations to their own foundation.

CNBC reported:

Clintons made $10.6 million in 2015, paid federal rate of 34%

Hillary and Bill Clinton released their 2015 tax returns on Friday, showing they paid $3.6 million in taxes on adjusted gross income of $10.6 million.

The release appeared to be aimed at drawing renewed attention to Donald Trump's refusal to release his own tax records.

The Clintons deducted $2.24 million last year, and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent and an effective combined tax rate of 43.2 percent. They gave 9.8 percent of their adjusted gross income to charity, according to a campaign release.

Of the the $1,042,000 the Clintons gave to charity as listed on their return, $1 million of that went to the Clinton Family Foundation.

Sounds like a pretty good racket.

Can everyone do this?
