Donald Trump , one of two remaining contenders to become daddy of the great nation U.S.A., loves babies so much . They're young and strong, and they symbolize the future of the country he hopes to rule. Just kidding! Get those babies out of here!

Trump was speaking at a rally in Ashburn, Virginia, on Tuesday when he interrupted a rant about Chinese banks to acknowledge a crying baby in the audience. At first he seemed sympathetic to the mother of the loud child, but he soon revealed that he was being sarcastic, and actually hates it when rude babies cry while he's trying to talk. Then he told her she could take her baby away.

I am not joking. This is a thing a major presidential candidate actually said and did. Here's the transcript:

And ABC News has the video of this very actual event in American politics.

Donald Trump is a person American voters have the option of electing to run the country's executive branch, putting him in charge of the world's largest military and giving him the power to nominate Supreme Court justices.

Also at his Tuesday rally, a young boy reportedly yelled, "Take that bitch down!" in reference to Trump's opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
